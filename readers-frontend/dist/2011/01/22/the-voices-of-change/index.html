          <div id="article-content" class="text-justify">"ENOUGH! Enough pain, enough tears, enough suffering, enough control, limitations, unjust justifications, terror, torture, excuses, bombings, sleepless nights, dead civilians, black memories, bleak future, heart-aching present, disturbed politics, fanatic politicians, religious bullshit, enough incarceration! WE SAY STOP! This is not the future we want! We want to be free. We want to be able to live a normal life. We want peace. Is that too much to ask?"

This is the Gazan Youth Manifesto, released on Facebook by a group of eight young people in a bid to make a stark change to the future that history is dictating. For a moment it drew Western eyes away from politicians, strategic plans, and peace talks, to hear what the young people on the ground had to say. Such an occurrence is a rarity, since, in the midst of a battle between views, opinions, and beliefs, the conflict has been gradually extracted from the hands of the citizens, and has morphed into a public international concern.

Of course, such leeway is necessary for an objective view on the matter, and particularly in recent months it has been Western politicians to have generated an insurgence of pressure to make progress. Although Barack Obama's one year deadline to make peace came to no avail, it instigated the first peace talks between Israel and Palestine for two years. More recently, Tony Blair, despite being a contentious individual in terms of foreign affairs, was nonetheless voicing a common sentiment in the West when, on 4th January he said: "We are talking about weeks, rather than months, for this process now to be rehabilitated and put back on track".

Yet with this added urgency must come the added question of, what will happen this time that is any different? Countless times has the world said things will change, and countless times has it come to no avail, or more commonly, worsened the situation.

Talking to Erika Moisl, Programme Director of the Encompass Trust - a community-based youth group working with Israel, Palestine, the UK, the US, and Indonesia - she agrees that the current proceedings do not spark optimism: "When Obama came in and said, right we're actually going to do something, then I did think that maybe it was going to work, but then it's stalled again. That's why, obviously it's going to have to be quite high level negotiations about what's going to happen, but I would hope that by having more grass root things going on that you have more people power involved in it and not just have the same politicians that are making all the decisions about it."

Encompass work on uniting the moderates, and the civilians of the younger generation, focusing on discussion and interaction between young people from the various countries with which they are associated, by way of sparking a mass change in attitude: "It has to start at some point: any revolution that's ever happened starts from people saying 'no, we need to make a change'.

"It is really, as they say, grassroot. By starting a movement where you get more people and you meet other people who also think like that you hopefully get some kind of revolution. That's what we're hoping for: a social revolution."

She highlights, however, the issue of expansiveness, as one that requires unity, seems so impenetrable: "I think a lot of the way the conflict or the events are presented in the media, it's just so massive that there's no way you can possibly get close to even do anything about it."

Sharing their views are four citizens (two from Israel, and two from Palestine) accompanied by those of Shmuel Ben-Tovim, an Israeli diplomat, and Joel Braunold, Director of Foreign Affairs for OneVoice Movement - a parallel working civil movement that attempts to build peaceful attitudes within each autonomous society. They look from all sides of the conflict at the plans being set out, the assertions being made, and to what extent they feel things can be shaped and changed.

"I think there can be a solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. There are many people in Palestine and Israel who want to have peace between us but unfortunately there is a big rift between the politicians. They are not interested in making peace because each government believes that that piece of land belongs to them. If they can understand that we can live together in this land without killing children, without a war, and without a check point, then we can reach peace.

Not all Palestinians living in Israel speak Hebrew, and there have been many times when my family and I have had problems with this. On check point the soldiers are very mean and some of them do know Arabic but they don't help. They hate us and our Israeli friend who voted for peace. We had a problem in the hospital, and in the market and many, many, many other things. I will never stop speaking out.

I spend two to four hours at check point every day. I'm always late for school and getting to work. There was one time when my grandmother was sick, and I was trying to get her to hospital. I spent so much time on check point that we were too late getting there, and she is now very sick. We need peace, we need to stop this war.

I can't hang out with my friends because I am living in Jerusalem, and my best friend lives in Ramalah on the West Bank, so we can't meet very often. If we did meet we wouldn't know where to go: I can't enter Ramalah, and she can't enter Jerusalem, so we can't hang out like people can in other countries. We prefer to spend time chatting on the internet or over the phone. I'm hoping, you could even say I'm dreaming, to hang out with my friends on the beach, or to go to the cinema. Finally, I am hoping to stop this conflict - the killing, the war - and have peace.

I think the West are interfering in many ways. There are positive and negative views of the West. The positive is that they help the Palestinian people with money, but the negative is that the West doesn't always listen to the truth. They see what happens in Gaza: children and old people are killed, check points are put up everywhere in sight in the West Bank, people can't find jobs, and sometimes they spend half the time they are supposed to be working at check point. I don't know what to say. There are many things that have happened and are still happening, I need so much time to explain it. You know, Israel does a lot of bad things and the West doesn't see it, and they seem to always be standing by Israel's side, which is why the Palestinians don't like the West, but at the same time we don't hate them. It's a hard question, and I can't express the feelings of all Palestinians people.

<blockquote class="left">I am living in Jerusalem and my best friend lives in Ramalah. I can't enter Ramalah</blockquote>

The main cause of this conflict was that the Israeli people came to our country, put their hand on it, and said "this is our country, not Arab". This comes from a conflict between their religion and our religion and the solution for this conflict, in my mind, will only be solved at the world's end.

Our President, Yaser Arafat, was, and still is, a godfather to us, like Jesus. No one knew him like us. I will never stop speaking about him and his history. I think he would have solved the problem with the help of God. God knows what happened to him if he wasn't killed at the hand of terrorism.

I don't think there will be anything achieved this year between the two countries because we are still at the mercy of the occupation. We have been occupied since '48 - its called Nakba (disaster) 48 - and we are still fighting for freedom. So there is nothing we can do but wait for a miracle. The Quran says that we will have freedom sooner or later."

"Asolution is always possible. But for that to happen both of us have to trust each other at the same time. Unfortunately, as things seem, a solution is very, very far from here.

Of course the conflict impacts on my daily life. I'm not talking about security checks everywhere; when 33% of the country's resources go to the army, and you're being made for 3 years of your life to serve in this army, that is your daily life. In the years that violence was high it was much worse: me and a lot of my friends lost many of our friends in suicide attacks and in combat. A dead friend is something you carry with you all your life.

<blockquote class="right">The West, the U.S. especially, have always thought they know what's better</blockquote>

The root of the problem is disbelief of both sides that peace can ever happen, and the fundamental fear of taking a step back. After so many years of violence and hate almost no one believes that the other side is interested or capable of anything but violence. Neither side sees the other as humans, but as "terrorists" or "soldiers". True peace is not done by governments, it's done by people, and the people need to start talking to each other, know each other, and humanize each other. Without this no solution will last.

I know quite a few Palestinians, some of them very good friends of mine. We found that we have more in common than what separates us, and that at the end of day, we all want to live in peace and safety, and that we all believe that basic human rights are for everyone. Unfortunately, I can't say that everyone else in this region thinks the same.

Personally I don't agree with the compulsory military service, and I resist the concept of armies in general. Violence is never a solution. A nation in which everyone has to go to the army will have a very hard time achieving peace, when military training is such a fundamental part of it's being, and that the collective myths and ethos it has are so deeply involved with it's military, and history of wars.

The "West" has good and bad influences on the Middle East. The big geo-political picture is very complex, and there are interests for both preserving and solving the Israeli - Palestinian conflict. In the recent years (since the Clinton administration, give or take) the international interference in the middle east is more about resolution. But then again, the West and especially the U.S. have always thought they know what's better for other nations, and by political colonialism they try to enforce their world view over cultures that they refuse to assess in their own cultural language. The West still has a lot to learn.

Israel is a nation in a post traumatic experience: the 2000 years of exile that Jews were hunted down by anti-semites had made their mark on our nation's ability to trust others. When the collective in Israel sees itself at war with the Palestinians, if the West seems to take the Palestinian position - and that's a matter of interpretation - he will be suspected for being anti Israeli. There is a lot of respect and even admiration of the west when it comes to culture, economy, etc., but when it comes to politics we don't like to be told what to do.

I hate to say this, but this year probably nothing will happen. It has been years since a serious negotiation has been made. Israel is building a wall of separation and the Palestinians are trying to be recognized internationally. And with the current Israeli government nothing will be achieved - only more violence and hate."

<strong>LAYALI FARHAN*

"Maybe be a solution will be possible or not. Since 1948 some Palestinian communist suggested having one country for both the Arabs and the Israelis, and that each one of them will keep its own language, religion and culture. The Israelis refused because they think that they are the best, but we were ready to share our land with them. This damaged everything. Then when their President Rabin came to hold a peace agreement with us they killed him. They don't want peace.

Arafat was fair, and able to create justice and peace. But they didn't want to make peace with him, yet they want us to give up and leave everything we have. Arafat spent his entire life fighting for Palestine and he knew what justice is, and the holy right to return back to home for every refugee.

From my experience I know Israeli people. Passing through borders and checkpoints gave me an unforgettable impression about their behaviour and feelings towards us. They always curse, insult and even attack us. I lived under siege and curfew for months, and I saw girls from my school killed by the Israeli army. I don't know what my feeling is: its ineffable. We face a huge amount of hate and racism for no reason. They don't talk to us as civilized people, and the only time any Israelis did was during the Encompass program.

<blockquote class="left">Since Netanyaho was elected we have lost them as a peace partner</blockquote>

This year I don't expect to achieve anything. What is obvious is that since Netanyaho was elected we have lost any chance of them as a peace partner. His policies are some of the most racist ones, starting from his attempt at judaization, changing the historic features of Jerusalem, killing, settlement, political prisoners, and the siege.

What I say may be different to another Palestinian because I speak from the point of view of a Palestinian refugee. I have spent my whole life in a refugee camp, and until now I don't know what my native land looks like. It's now included in so-called Israel, and I am not allowed to go there."

<strong>ERAN ROASH*

"The conflict definitely impacts on my daily life as a citizen because each time something happens in which an Israeli or a Palestinian citizen gets hurt, the conflict gets worse and our life as citizens gets worse. The conflict is a bit different between the government and certain areas of Israel.

The main root of the problem is that each nation has its own truth and none is ready to compromise. Both are right and that's the root of the problem. But I do think there can and will be a solution to the conflict. I think that the best solution is two separate countries, and nations, divided by the borders of 1967.

Personally, I think Arafat did some good by trying to find a solution despite facing strong accusation of corruption, and stealing the money of his nation.

The West are interfering without a doubt, although the reasons are too complex for me to understand or explain. There isn't very much prejudice against them as Israel is very connected to the West. However, a lot of people believe most of the West simply can't understand a conflict that they are not part of.

<blockquote class="right">Personally I think Arafat did some good by trying to find a solution</blockquote>

Compulsory military service in Israel has massive benefits, not only to each person as an individual, but even more importantly: as a nation it brings us all together. It lets us know that we are able to enjoy relative freedom in our own homes, which isn't easy to come by in Israel. As an individual it gives you a lot of maturity in a very early level of life. It makes you understand what is really important in life: what's really worth it and what's not. And, of course, there is the benefit that the army opens doors for you as a citizen.

Before serving in the military we have an optional year called Mechina. It is amazing and probably a one of a kind opportunity to experience and understand your identity as a Jew, and as a citizen in Israel, but most important of all: as a person living on this planet. The whole process is very strong for my spirituality."

<h2>Outside Perspective</h2>

<strong>SHMUEL BENTOVIM
<em>Israeli Diplomat</em></strong>

"I think that a major breakthrough can happen if the entire Arab League put their weight on an ideal. If they consider a condition at the end of the talks and the entire Arab League backs the Palestinians, then it puts the Hamas and the extremists into such a corner.

This conflict is very, very complicated and has been going on for so long. In my view, there are many complications of course - there's Jerusalem, there are settlements, there are many obstacles - but basically, both youth and the politicians need to cross one line. This is recognising each others' right.

Recently, even the right-wing Israeli president Netanyahu admitted that the solution should be two states: one Palestinian, and the question is, what of the other state? The Palestinians look at the new state that they have created as the nation state of the Palestinian people. Israel looks at Israel in the new border that will be agreed, as the nation state of the Jewish people but this statement is not at all acceptable by the Palestinians. They don't recognize the right of the Jewish people to have its own nation state. There will be Israel, and the new Palestinian state, and the Palestinian refugees will choose wherever they want to go back to.

The question of physical security and mental security for Israelis is that for once we recognise that there is a state of Israel, with a Jewish identity - it can be smaller and give up land - but at the end of the day the final result of the discussions and the agreement is two nation states, one for the Palestinians, one of the Jewish people. This is something that people tend to forget, that stands at the base of this country.

<blockquote class="left">Maybe the current generation in power are not mentally prepared for settlement</blockquote>

This is something, again, that the younger generation, I think, can find much easier to do in the fresh mind and fresh look at the conflict.

I think community-based schemes are extremely important because in a sense the older generation is a lost generation: it's so much involved and stringed into this process - the psychological process - that nothing can be achieved. Maybe the current generation in power, and the older generation, are not mentally prepared for settlement. This can change, with the younger generation."

<strong>JOEL BRAUNOLD
<em>Director of External Relations, OneVoice</em></strong>

"I think the most important thing to be done is something that's been lost in the process. That lack of trust is truly and utterly the biggest obstacle to peace, because no one is willing to go out on a limb if they don't think they'll be met half way.

Something we pride ourselves in doing is demonstrating that there is a partner for peace on the other side, not by bringing Israelis and Palestinians together, by demonstrating, through public polling, opening up the toxic issues about how far each side is willing to go to end the conflict in each society. I n doing so, we're really revealing the humanity of the other side.

What you've seen from the collapse of the peace talks is a true urgency ejected into the international community. For the last five years people have been saying this is urgent, time is running out. The international community has finally picked up on that message. From that pressure and that focus on trying to sort out the conflict, I think there will be some kind of resolution, because I don't think the international community will allow the conflict to go on for much longer.

<blockquote class="right">The amount of pressure that's about to be put on is going to be quite unprecedented</blockquote>

What has happened is that the international community have woken up to the fact that the issue of Israel and Palestine is now having a blow back on their own streets and their own national security doctrines. As such, the urgency to solve it is no longer a humanitarian one, but one of their own causes, and I think that's going to be the motivation for a lot of states. Whether that's ethical or moral is questionable, but I think that's going to add an added urgency to the entire issue.

What's important to say from our point of view is that the populations have always been traditionally more advanced than their leaders in getting nearer to a two-state solution but due to the despair that's been caused by constant failure. There needs to be a real emphasis put back into civil society that this is possible to do. And what the moderates need is just a single win - just something to show that negotiations can deliver some progress, rather than just violence and rejection.

I think there's never been as much pressure for something to happen as there is today. None can predict the future on this one, but the amount of pressure that's about to be put on is going to be quite unprecedented. You're going to have a great involvement from the European Union, and far more pushing to the international community than you've seen before."</div>
