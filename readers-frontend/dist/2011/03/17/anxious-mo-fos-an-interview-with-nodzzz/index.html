In 2007, a wave of bands from disparate scenes brought the spirit of DIY indie to prominence, picking up and running with that noble tradition so lovingly documented in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Our-Band-Could-Your-Life/dp/0316787531">Michael Azerrad's book</a> 'Our Band Could Be Your Life'. There was an odd tradition with some of the groups re-igniting this aesthetic for the 21st Century - filling their band names with multiple consonants. From San Diego came stoner antagonists <a href="http://wavves.net/">Wavves</a>, Sacramento's <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Mayyors">Mayyors </a>tore noise rock a new one, while back home Nottingham's <a href="http://lovvers-letscommunicate.blogspot.com/">Lovvers </a>performed necromantic rites on the carcasses of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA7oTXlyBv4">The Jesus Lizard</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WD2pUTO9uU">Flipper</a>. My favourite <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBKg9GpzEY">Carol Vorderman</a>-aneurysm-monikered band to be associated with that movement, which still undoubtedly influences the current lo-fi climate, is definitely San Francisco's <a href="http://nodzzz.blogspot.com/">Nodzzz</a>. An unpretentious, fun loving, yet fiercely intelligent three piece, clearly fervent believers in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLRj253FelU&feature=related">Minutemen's</a> mantra of 'jamming econo', their debut 7" '<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCF6faXPjCY">(I Don't Wanna) Smoke Marijuana</a>' reached cult status, a brief, super-catchy slice of nerdy garage rock that had as much in common with mischievous English post-punks like <a href="http://www.televisionpersonalities.co.uk/">Television Personalities</a> as it did with the heroes of the 80's US underground. Their 2008 self-titled debut (ten songs in seventeen minutes) seemed to perfectly re-capture that era where <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6hgsr_roadrunner-the-modern-lovers-jonath_music">punk gained a brain</a>; filled with power-pop hooks and self-deprecating wit which couldn't help but charm whoever heard it. After a three year wait the band are touring in anticipation of their sophomore LP, <em>Innings</em>, having recently signed to <a href="http://www.woodsist.com/">Woodsist</a>, a label who've released fantastic bands like <a href="http://www.myspace.com/realestate">Real Estate</a>, <a href="http://www.moonduo.org/fr_about.cfm">Moon Duo</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ohsees">Thee Oh Sees</a>. With original drummer Pete Hilton back on the stool for a while during time off from serving in the <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/">Peace Corps</a> in <a href="http://www.bulgariatravel.org/eng/index.php">Bulgaria</a>, it's the perfect time to catch up with the original line-up. The band is completed by guitarist Sean Paul Presley and enthusiastic singer Anthony Atlas, who at first seems more excited in talking about my current essay reconciling <a href="http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/">Beckett </a>and <a href="http://www.imagi-nation.com/moonstruck/clsc19.html">Ionesco </a>with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_modernism">high modernism</a> than he is talking about his music. Nodzzz are certainly everything you could hope for in a college rock band; sweet, clever, interesting, self-effacing, witty, and most of all, fun.

<strong><em>NOUSE</em>: You've listed your influences as 'British New Wave singles from the 70's and 80's' but to me you sound more like a mixture of early proto-punk like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k43XjuhInkU">The Modern Lovers</a> and DIY punk like Minutemen or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaUzYISKKAI">Wipers</a>. What kind of stuff did you set out to play?</strong>
<em>Anthony (Vocals/Guitar)</em>: With that description, it wasn't really New Wave that I was trying to compare us to. It was just the idea that every song would count. We're really intense about making every song interesting rather than creating a 'sound'; I mean, if we pay enough attention to each song lyrically and musically, we feel like every song could be a single. If you look at that area of music as a whole there are so many prolific bands just making every song seem really important, you know...

<strong><em>NOUSE</em>: Yeah, I mean, that first 7" you did, '(I Don't Wanna) Smoke Marijuana', you didn't even put that on the LP. Was there a reason for that, or did it stem from that same kind of outlook?</strong>
<em>Anthony</em>: Yeah, well, we felt like it needed its own space because it was such a silly song. We believe in that song in a way but also, that seemed to be the only format for it. 
<em>Sean (Guitar)</em>: As a single. It's interesting because the '<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_48pBX4VNQ">True to Life</a>' single is on the upcoming record, and it's a different version, too. 
<em>Anthony</em>: It was almost like, a different world of time when we did that 'I Don't Wanna...' 7" to when we put out the first record. 

<strong><em>NOUSE</em>: So was there a particular reason you re-recorded 'True to Life'?</strong>
<em>Anthony</em>: I love the idea of different versions of songs. I mean, when people buy bootlegs and oddity records, it's always interesting to hear different versions to what you've heard. What an industry of <a href="http://www.bobsboots.com/">Bob Dylan bootlegs </a>there is. How many different versions... it's crazy. But I think also that the group of songs that we have on the new record were all written in a period after Pete's departure from the band in 2008...
<em>Pete (Drums)</em>: I don't actually play on the new record.
<em>Anthony</em>: Right, and I think it made sense aesthetically to have that song be in the mix with all the other songs on the record. 
<a href="http://www.nouse.co.uk/2011/03/17/anxious-mo-fos-an-interview-with-nodzzz/idontwanna/" rel="attachment wp-att-36788"><img src="[ARCHIVECDNURL]/articleImages/body/2011/03/idontwanna.jpg" alt="" title="idontwanna" width="320" height="318" class="alignright size-full wp-image-36788" /></a>
<strong><em>NOUSE</em>: Do you think your influences are much different now than they were back in 2007 when you first got noticed? </strong>
<em>Sean</em>: Well for one, yeah, Anthony doesn't play bass anymore.
<em>Anthony</em>: Yeah, I used to be the bassist in the band, I picked up the guitar, but over the course of the last three or four years since we recorded that first single, and last three years since Pete's left, I think that naturally one's tastes and experiences grow and change and it would be impossible for that to keep from informing the music. So alongside taste changes and experience changes, we're creating a different kind of music. 

<strong><em>NOUSE</em>: Is there anything specifically, that you're listening to or have been influenced by, in the run-up to the new album's recording?</strong>
<em>Anthony</em>: I used to avoid ornament, and elaborate guitar. I'd chastise Sean for playing leads - noodly leads - but now I love the noodles. 
<em>Sean</em>: Bands like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCRdY7ZH7xo">Felt </a>maybe opened you to the noodle? 
<em>Anthony</em>: If it sounds pretty, it's ok to noodle. Otherwise it's just <a href="http://www.chefboyardee.com/products.jsp">Chef Boyardee</a>.

<strong><em>NOUSE</em>: So maybe English indie-pop has had some sort of bearing on the new sound?</strong>
<em>Anthony</em>: Sure, but also <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwJMdeWqlw">Jonathan Richman</a>, which is the most basic of American rock & roll, you know. His trajectory went from three chord, simple, stripped down, to... I just think he felt like his guitar was his own voice, and to restrain that voice was to limit his songs. 

<strong><em>NOUSE</em>: 'From Bleak to Blech' is your latest release, 300 hand-numbered cassettes. Why are you trying to bring back that format in particular, something to do with nostalgia for the 80's DIY scene?</strong>
<em>Anthony</em>: We suddenly felt like we had enough fragmented and rejected songs that were legitimate in their own right. And we're a band of limited means so someone offered to pay for that run, and selling them on the tour made perfect sense. It also seemed like a good moment because Pete's back in the band for a little bit, whenever he can play, and he's on the whole A side. Those are all songs from the demo and first 7" and Pete's handiwork.
<em>Pete</em>: I mean, along with the first 7" we recorded, what, fourteen songs or something? And that's where '...Marijuana' and '<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3b61ynOByo">We Are the Only Animals</a>' came from. So when they got offered to do this tape they wanted to put those songs on it, because they hadn't re-recorded them for the LP or anything like that.
<em>Anthony</em>: We did think about re-recording a couple but they still seem cool to me, we kind of believe that those versions are definitive.
<em>Pete</em>: They kind of existed in a certain time, you know.
<em>Sean</em>: Unless the well runs dry, and we do the <a href="http://www.4ad.com/pixies/">Pixies </a>move; <em><a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/trompe-le-monde-r15335">Trompe le Monde</a></em> has, like, three songs from that <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Pixies-The-Purple-Tape-2/release/1862290"><em>Purple Tape</em></a>. They kept dipping back to their demo.
<em>Anthony</em>: A lot of bands do that. We won't be one of them.

<strong><em>NOUSE</em>: Talking of new material, what's the deal?</strong>
<em>Anthony</em>: Well, we should introduce the new record. It's called <em>Innings</em> and it comes out May 17th on the Woodsist label, with fourteen songs. A couple have made appearances on compilations in the past but most of it's brand new. Since recording that, new stuff's been scant because we've all been stressed, but it's like <a href="http://www.tompetty.com/">Tom Petty</a> says, after an album you need a good nine month break before making any fresh material.
<em>Sean</em>: That's the perfect maxim, a beautiful phrase... After nine months, you're ready to give birth again!

<strong><em>NOUSE</em>: Did you feel challenged by following up the first record, or did it come naturally?</strong>
<em>Anthony</em>: I felt like I was encouraged by the response to that first record, it seemed like such a surprise to us that people would care. The songwriting seemed like a fun goal, not something to get stressed about.

<strong><em>NOUSE</em>: When you guys first came out there were quite a few bands celebrated in a similar vein - Wavves, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8umvDMhjQM">Black Lips</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KirAFfKGdlI">Vivian Girls</a>. Did you feel part of a movement or was it more a case of journalists lumping together vaguely related bands?</strong>
<em>Sean</em>: We definitely got lumped in with all that. 
<em>Anthony</em>: But I personally felt more connected to silly 90's quirky indie-pop from Olympia, like <a href="http://www.killrockstars.com/artists/viewartist.php?id=200">the Frumpies</a>, or even <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGMd9zQt8TE">Beat Happening</a>. I was in a band in San Francisco called The Study Buddies and we released a five song CDR in 2004-2005, and that was like a proto-Nodzzz thing for me. At that point we were super-isolated from the music scene at large. When we got started in San Francisco with Pete and Sean I think it was just coincidental that a lot of people were feeling the same influences and creating music that was similar. But we didn't know who any of those Columbus bands were; I found out about <a href="http://www.myspace.com/tyvekmusic">Tyvek</a>, for example, through our label.

<strong><em>NOUSE</em>: I thought you sound a lot more poppy and hooky than a lot of the bands whose names are thrown around in pieces about you guys. Kind of making concise pop-punk maybe in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuggets:_Original_Artyfacts_from_the_First_Psychedelic_Era,_1965%E2%80%931968">Nuggets </a>vein.</strong>
<em>Sean</em>: When I first got exposed to all those Nuggets comps and stuff like that; it struck me that it was very economical but they were all bastard pop songs. 
<em>Anthony</em>: Those songs are so big because they're commercial hits, and a song that can exploit commercial tastes that's concise, forceful, intelligible and catchy - I think that's the basic requirements of a good song. We decided that we won't be a band about gesture or sound, we'll be very song-orientated.

<strong><em>NOUSE</em>: Do you feel like you work better at getting across pop sensibilities rather than doing the punk thing?</strong>
<em>Anthony</em>: At the moment I feel inspired by things that are pop and well crafted, that's more demanding. The punk thing kind of comes as second nature; we all grew up playing in hardcore bands. And that's where our technique comes from.
<em>Sean</em>: And if a slow song doesn't sound right, we'll probably just resort to double timing it; and there's a new song. 

<strong><em>NOUSE</em>: Would you be happy as an obscure little band on a future Nuggets-style compilation, getting some love from a record nerd, or do you strive for more than that?</strong>
<em>Anthony</em>: I think that the goal was always to put out music that we enjoyed that validated our own tastes, maybe. The intention to be a very successful band, I think was never in the charter. 
<em>Sean</em>: Our new record just went on presale today on <a href="http://www.insound.com/">Insound</a>, and they put it side by side with all our previous releases on the website, and I just felt super-proud of everything. Just seeing those three squares side by side was just the apex of my enjoyment of this band. Three little beautiful squares, it's a body of work that I'm really proud of. 
<em>Pete</em>: I've been absent from the band for three years at this point I'm back for a temporary period now. When me and Anthony started jamming - we've known each other since Fourth Grade or something - it started really nonchalantly, it was just for fun, just to play together, and with the LP and the 7", the two records I played on, I couldn't be any happier with them even now, three years later. For me, I've accomplished more with this band than I ever thought was gonna happen anyway. It was all just for fun.

<a href="http://www.nouse.co.uk/2011/03/17/anxious-mo-fos-an-interview-with-nodzzz/nodzzz_2/" rel="attachment wp-att-36792"><img src="[ARCHIVECDNURL]/articleImages/body/2011/03/nodzzz_2.jpg" alt="" title="nodzzz_2" width="320" height="320" class="alignright size-full wp-image-36792" /></a>

<strong><em>NOUSE</em>: If each of you could pick a record that sums up what you want to capture with Nodzzz, what would it be?</strong>
<em>Pete</em>: Although I don't think we sound like them at all, when we started playing we were listening to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJYjr-vUKZM">Dead Milkmen</a>, 'Big Lizard in my Backyard', great record. 
<em>Anthony</em>: There's what, like 21 songs on there or something?
<em>Pete</em>: Right, when we were talking about playing music, it was - let's sound like this. But I don't think it turned out like that at all.
<em>Anthony</em>: The cool thing with Dead Milkmen is with that record, you don't think of it as this sequenced, calculated album. Every song is melodic, every song has a variety of social stances on something, it's funny, it's also rooted in existential anxiety. It's not just a punk record, it's something that you can enjoy when you're 12 or 25. 
<em>Pete</em>: That's the first punk record I ever had. 
<em>Anthony</em>: For me, now, I look at any of the first three Television Personalities LPs, for having breathtakingly deep songs that are still rooted to very visual, accessible aspects of our experience, with their analogies to pop culture and art. The whole body of work of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2007/jun/29/thefallarethegreatestband">The Fall</a>, too. You can read those songs from any perspective and they're still meaningful.

<strong><em>NOUSE</em>: Talking of Television Personalities, there's that horrible story of <a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/interviews/10459-60-seconds-dan-treacy">Dan Treacy</a> getting that support slot for <a href="http://www.whoismgmt.com/uk/home">MGMT </a>in London after they did <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQKSIPhuqe4">a song about him</a>. It was gonna be a big moment where the band were actually gonna have a decent crowd for once, but he got <a href="http://www.nme.com/news/mgmt/50290">stuck in traffic</a> and missed it. Typical English cock-up.</strong>
<em>Anthony</em>: Oh, no. Did you hear about our show in London a few days ago? We have a friend called Josh Alper who put out a Television Personalities 7", and he encouraged Dan Treacy to go to our show. And said that if he went <a href="http://www.siltbreeze.com/mantles.htm">the Mantles </a>[current tour support] would buy him some beers. And through this e-mail correspondence they planned that Dan would <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0YNOQrmyM8">come up onstage</a> during the Mantles set and play 'I Remember Bridget Riley'. So he showed up with his girlfriend and we bought him beers, took pictures with him, and he got up and did the song... it was nuts.
<em>Sean</em>: I was kind of insanely jealous.
<em>Anthony</em>: I was jealous, to an extent. I was like, 'As long as he stays to watch us...'. After we played he came up and said 'I really love your songs! I sense all these influences... <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264235/">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>?!' But then he said <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_59XEJxqq5c">the Feelies</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ra8VTlXVqUQ">Violent Femmes</a>, so he totally read our band, just fucking got it. He was such a decent person, so warm, and despite the troubles people describe him as having, he seemed utterly in control of his wit and his artistic sense.

<strong><em>NOUSE</em>: Sean, you didn't mention a record that you aspired to?</strong>
Sean: Well, the funny thing with the Curb Your Enthusiasm reference is that I think our music has a comedic aspect to it, maybe? Like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szhJzX0UgDM">the B-52s</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbt30UnzRWw">Devo</a>. Bands that didn't take their deal too seriously. I think, fortunately or unfortunately, with a name like Nodzzz it's a sentence to not take our deal too seriously. I guess that's kind of our mantra, in a sense. 

<strong><em>NOUSE</em>: I think that's what's cool, though. A lot of those bands that we were talking about you having been lumped in with I thought took themselves too seriously or were taken too seriously by people. </strong>
<em>Sean</em>: I think that if you take yourself too seriously that transfers to your live show and it seems really impersonal. A stage is already such an intimidating thing to the band and audience, that you feel like you're going to a museum - there's no connection. 
<em>Anthony</em>: Last night I had the giggles. I couldn't stop - it felt like I was throwing off a whole show. I saw some of the guys from Mantles watching us and it wasn't anything specific, but I got stricken with a sense of the absurdity of what we were doing... I couldn't sing, I was just laughing from the corner of my mouth, and trying not to look at Pete and... I've never seen any band do that. It was kind of like laughing at a funeral, that sense of 'Oh fuck, I'm laughing'. I felt bad but, it's just such an unserious thing. You can approach it as a craft or a private joy but we can't assert the legitimacy here, you know; I mean, Sean's strumming six strings and Pete's bashing on circles, I'm making sounds with my mouth... in terms of world circumstances you can't take this shit seriously at all.

<strong><em>NOUSE</em>: OK, penultimate question: what are your favourite recent bands and movies at the moment that you reckon people should check out?</strong>
<em>Sean</em>: I think we're lucky to be touring with Mantles. They're stellar, so warm - flawless.
<em>Pete</em>: I just got back from Bulgaria, so all I get is radio pop music. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e82VE8UtW8A">Rihanna </a>is my jam.
<em>Sean</em>: I don't wanna just reference San Francisco bands, but I really love that new <a href="http://killrockstars.com/artists/viewartist.php?aname=widow">Grass Widow</a> record. <em>True Grit's</em> a good movie. <a href="http://www.coenbrothers.net/">Coen brothers</a>.
<em>Anthony</em>: <em>A Serious Man</em> is superior, though. I can relate to it... hopeless Jewish angst. With current bands, I guess <a href="http://kurtvile.com/jesusfever/">Kurt Vile</a>, <a href="http://www.4ad.com/ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/">Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti</a>, the new <a href="http://www.myspace.com/cassmccombs">Cass McCombs</a> single, the new <a href="http://www.softabuse.com/artists/sonny_and_sunsets.html">Sonny & the Sunsets</a>. I saw a band in San Francisco recently called <a href="http://bronze.bandcamp.com/">Bronze</a>, who are more synth-orientated, and dark - but amazing. Utterly unique music; one of the players has a strange soundbox that he built, which he cranks to make weird noises, and when he turns it, it warps the sound. They're a three piece; strange box, vocals and synth, drums. It was such an impactful show.

<strong><em>NOUSE</em>: Finally, if you don't want to smoke marijuana to get high, what drugs would you recommend?</strong>
<em>Anthony</em>: Well I'm a lightweight because I have anxiety, and most drugs increase anxiety, so I keep it to things that seem to be almost engineered to enhance people, medically. So I stick to pills, and every now and then I might drink <a href="http://www.poppies.org/faq/poppy-tea/">poppy tea</a>. But I think opiates are a dangerous and dark road. You can only look out at that road from your window and enjoy the view. Don't actually go down that road. Sean?
<em>Sean</em>: Um... antibiotics. I get high on health. You can get high on being a wonderfully functional water-fuelled individual.
<em>Anthony</em>: Aw, now it just sounds like I'm a junkie.
