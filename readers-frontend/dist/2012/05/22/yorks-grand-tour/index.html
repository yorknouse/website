          <div id="article-content" class="text-justify">Professor Anthony Robards OBE has been described as the 'interface between the University of York and businesses, the City and the Region'. He co-founded both the local Science Park and Science City York, was President of the Microscopical Society and has published over 130 books and papers in biological research, both pure and applied. Obtaining his OBE in 2002 for 'Services to Higher Education' and a 'Lifetime Achievement Award' at the Yorkshire Evening Press Business Awards ceremony in 2003, it could  be argued that Professor Robards has played a critical role in the development of York into the city it is today.

He now divides his time between working for the University of York, involving himself with charitable works and sitting on the board of a number of companies. His latest project is the York Science and Innovation Grand Tour, an interactive open-air exhibition around the heart of York which seeks to demonstrate to residents and visitors that science and innovation in York is something to get excited about.

<strong>We understand you were a co-founder of the Science Park, can you tell us a bit about that?</strong>
Well, it was a group effort. In fact, it was a whole university activity. So there are no individual people, but I was chairman of the Science Park company for a couple of years. The Science Park started in the late 80s, with one or two ties to start it off. We began in right fashion, and the lead player in the Science Park was Smith & Nephew. Who still have their global research premises here.

<strong>So what is your current primary role?</strong>
Now, I'm semi-retired, I'm still on the Science Park board but no longer chairman, I also sit on the board of one or two university spin-off companies. One of the ones I'm the chairman of is York Cancer Research, and I've always been interested in research and what it means. Hence being involved in things like cancer charities and being on the board of companies, I've always wanted to see things happen.

<strong>Is this Grand Tour to bring attention to York Science?</strong>
Yep, well I was a co-founder of Science City in the 90s. We created something which was really a partnership between the university, the city of York council and the local business industry, particularly the bioscience community and mainly for mutual benefit. Subsequently, in the last government, George Brown created five more science cities, but York was the first. And it was all to try to move the economy, which in York had previously been based on heavy engineering, railways and confectionary. There had been a reduction in the number of jobs there. For example, confectionary is still doing immensely well in York, but with far fewer employees. So we tried to make the case that York could become somewhere where its economic development, if not economic activity, very much based on the knowledge-based companies, especially with a burgeoning university.

<strong>But biology particularly?</strong>
Well, biology especially because in the mid-90s, it was probably the largest department in the university. Certainly by spend, if not by student number. So it was doing very well, and continues to do so. Smith & Nephew moved here around about 1990, a research company with 200 staff, the then Ministry of Agriculture moved about 11 or 12 labs from all over the South into a vast new premises at Sand Hutton, so 600+ scientists there. Nestle took over Rowntree and contrary to what was expected, instead of shutting down the research labs there, they have continuously invested in them. In fact there's a major investment going on there now. So over quite a short period of time, of just a few years, York found itself the home of a strong academic bioscience base, Smith & Nephew - a healthcare company, Nestle - a confectionary company based on science and the Ministry of Agriculture.

<strong>So it all came together at the same time?</strong>
It all came together. And all the chief executives and the vice chancellor came together to say 'what can we do to work together better?' 'can we share library facilities and some of the very expensive capital equipment?' It all made good sense.

<strong>Did anything help this along?</strong> 
I had a bit to do with stirring the pot at that time, but obviously it had to be done with the good will and support of the leaders. Ron Cooke, the old vice chancellor at the University of York and a man called Peter Stanley, who was director of the Central Science Laboratory. They all saw this as a good idea, it was mutual self-help. And from that the city council started to get involved, they saw all these jobs being lost and asked where they would get new ones from. It was out of that precedence that the Science City was born. But the point of saying that was a very full consultancy report undertaken to start Science City off, asking if the idea was going to get us anywhere.

A very large study was done by Ernst & Young, which acted as the bible for Science City for the first three or four years of its existence. The questions were: 'is this bioscience York going to get us anywhere in economic development?' If so, 'are there other sectors if should look at?' And if so, 'what do we do next?' And the answer was 'yes, you have a critical mass in bioscience, keep on with that' there were also other sectors; at the time it was IT which was very strong. We had uncovered a lot of very small one or two person companies around York, so we had to concentrate on that and make use of the technology involved with your arts and heritage, because there was a lot of that in archaeology. So that's where we are, still now, quite a long time later. We still have the bioscience, we've still got the IT, the arts and heritage has mutated slightly towards creative industry, but this embraces that. But the key point which brings us back full circle is that in that Ernst & Young study the emphasis was on winning the hearts and minds of the people. To get them on side. We all love science, nobody gets by without science, but the public at large still thinks it's a bit spooky!

<strong>Would you say that making science less spooky is the main aim of the Grand Tour?</strong>
To a large extent it is to take science and innovation to two main audiences. One is the residents of York and the other is the 7 million visitors to York each year. To the residents, it's to say great things, there are jobs here for your kids, it's helping to strengthen the economy and York wouldn't be anything like the place it is now if it weren't for science technology and knowledge-based businesses that are growing around the city. And for the visitors, we're internationally known as a nice heritage place, bit soft maybe, we're not a Manchester or a Birmingham, but underlying York has a real strong capability in its business, we want to show it as a business centre.

<strong>What was the inspiration behind the project?</strong>
There was a similar concept in 2008 - organised by Janet Barns, who is chief executive of the York Museums Trust, she looks after the castle museum, the art galleries, all the city-owned museums and galleries in York. The Museums Trust worked jointly with the National Gallery to produce the last 'grand tour' which had been previously been in the City of London. It featured about 50 large-scale high resolution reproductions; Rubens, van Gogh's and the like and that was wonderful.

But as a scientist a lot of my background has been in using microscopes, studying the beauty of nature. When you look at nature on both a macro scale and down a microscope, sometimes you see the most wonderfully beautiful things. And I thought we could use some wonderful images from science and technology and that they would tell a story. So, we've pretty much stayed true to that first ideal.

<strong>Can you tell us a few specifics about what this tour will consist of?</strong>
We've got about 60 images, for example we have some spectacular fluorescent-stained prostate cancer stem cells. They're generally about just over metre wide and will be in high footfall areas of York, mainly within the walls of the city but a few are outside on the way to the station. Most of them will be screwed to buildings, and laminated to protect them from the weather and graffiti.

The three criteria for our exhibits are that they must be stunning images, it must have something to do with York and it's got to be able to tell a story.

<strong>We noticed the QR codes on the image, what sort of interactivity is going to take place?</strong>
I've been very keen on that, so to start off there will be a QR code on each image which will link to the Grand Tour website for that image, and there will be more information on that page. For some, such as the Nestle images, it will take the viewer to the page of the Nestle exhibit and if Nestle want to advertise jobs or whatever, they can do so through that page. There will be both iPhone and Android apps, but obviously none of this comes until the very last moment. It launches two weeks from today and there is also a tour guide which will be quite a large pull-out with every images on it, because although it's nice to have the apps, most people will like to have a bit of paper in their hands. The other good thing it'll do for us and I mentioned this when we first started talking was to keep a sense of legacy and we'll be compiling a large evaluation, because if it's anything good at all I think it might be something which York might to do themed a bit differently, for example creative industry.

<strong>Who submitted the images?</strong>
They're all York-based, although we have some international companies which are based here, for example Nestle and naturally we had to be careful that they were not overtly advertising themselves! We have an image from them which is the cross-section of a cabbage, and it's a nice artistic image. Why is it there? Because all of the pigments in Smarties are now drawn from natural products, such as the red cabbage. So there's a nice story.
One that I particularly like is of a trumpet, we have the bell of a fanfare trumpet which has been computer simulated so that the vibrations have been colour coded onto it. But why should that be there? Why is that interesting? On each image there will be a short 'Did You Know?', with a few words telling you, for example, 'Did you know that Richard Smith, who lives just outside York, designs his trumpets on the basis of quantum physics to ensure that the vibrations are as perfect as possible and that his trumpets are going to be used for the opening of the Olympics and in the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations?' And that's great, but most people in York wouldn't know that! So it's an interesting application of science to a real world problem.

<strong>What's going to happen to the images after the Grand Tour?</strong>
Most of the images will go back to the original sponsors, for example Nestle is currently in the middle of an expansion of their product technology centre, their research labs which is going to open in September. They were, when we first spoke to them about contributing, very keen to retain their three images, partly because they would be nice images to have but also because they could be used to demonstrate Nestle's community engagement activities.
So how long has this idea been in the making? Did it originate with the last Grand Tour?
Well, I formed the idea quite quickly but then getting people involved with it has been a big part of my life over the last year or so. Firstly, I spoke to a man called Bill Woolley, the deputy chief executive of the council, because the first thing was that if we didn't get the council on side, we weren't going to go anywhere. But then, who else? We formed a small company which was purely there as a vehicle to give the project some substance, it features both universities, the council, the Museums Trust, Visit York and Science City York as its partners. So whoever you think would be interested in taking part in this was there.

<strong>Was all the funding from the partners?</strong>
No, not at all. This was the trickiest aspect of the whole project. The whole thing cost about a quarter of a million pounds, luckily I'm in the time of my life when I could put a lot of time into this without worrying too much. So we did a lot with in kind contributions, for example, there wasn't a cost element to obtaining the sites. Where we've got the money from was, well for each image we needed about PS2000 which sounds like a lot, about a quarter of that goes into the direct costs of producing the image, but if you think about it's things like websites, apps, marketing, design and creativity takes up the rest. So there's a large amount of work which goes on behind the scenes which required quite a big spend. But we're just about break-even.

<strong>Are there any plans to have other projects, of a vaguely similar nature, with the same partners?</strong>
Not on the table at the moment, I think York is a pretty well joined-up city in many ways, so for example there is an organisation called HigherYork which brings together all the institutions involved with Higher Education, similarly VisitYork. So with this Grand Tour 'vehicle', we haven't spoken about doing anything specifically together but it doesn't preclude it of course.

<strong>It seems like what we were talking about with the Science Park, everything coming together at the right time, do we have a similar situation with the Grand Tour?</strong>
Timing is everything really, I think if we tried to start this a year later it may have been different. Naturally, approaching small companies with the idea of coughing up a few thousand pounds so that they would get a picture on the wall which wouldn't overtly advertise them was hard so close to the economic downturn. But it is a matter of the right time, the right people in place and all the rest of it, just like so much in life.
