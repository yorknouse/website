A big part of University life is getting involved in societies. Some of the societies you join will become things you do for the rest of your life, and you'll make friends who you can share these passions with. One of the main advantages of societies though is to get away from the work of a stressful degree and have an excuse just to chill out and have fun. Some societies are more focused on academia, working on skills that you already have and want to be better at.  

Guaranteed though, what ever you're looking for there is a society dedicated to it, with people in it who like what you like. There's always somewhere to fit in. This <em>Nouse </em>Societies guide 2012 will tell you a bit about all the societies here at the University of York so that you make sure you find what you're looking for. If you like the sound of one you find here, check out their website or go find them at Freshers' Fair on the Saturday of Freshers' Week. And if even then you can't find anything you like, you can always start your own society.

<em>If we have missed your society out, please contact editor@nouse.co.uk to let us know</em>
