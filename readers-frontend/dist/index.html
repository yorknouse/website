into the second prod-week of my time as Deputy Muse Editor and it is fair to say I have some urgent questions: how many soy chocolate milks can I possibly drink in one week? How long will Andy allow the office to leech off his Spotify account? Why did the li-brary change sandwich supplier? When will I ever fit in time to do my degree?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis week I have undoubtedly felt more comfortable in my role, and I hope the same could be said for the rest of the team. It is so refreshing to be surrounded by people collaborating to create something that they are proud of. I think that&#39;s why I love MUSE so much; the editors have such passion for their section, and it&#39;s often infectious. When the socio-economical and political reality of 2018 is so bleak, it is often these other aspects of our culture that keep me positive; Brexit is a complete mess, but at least we can celebrate wonderful literature such as Matilda, or pay tribute to the life and works of lesser known artists, as Andy has done this edition with his feature on Charles Bradley.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSpeaking of lesser known individuals, this week I have found myself thinking a lot about our \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;ancestors\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; here at MUSE. As a history student, I am often frustrated by the constant focus on the huge names of the past and want to learn about the lives of ordinary people or about an unknown individual&#39;s story that actually influenced many.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNouse is a perfect ex-ample of such.While most people wouldn&#39;t recognise the name of Nouse&#39;s founder, Nigel Fountain, I wonder what I&#39;d be doing now had it not been for that first team producing Nouse. I prob-ably would have been involved with student media, but in what capacity? Would I have found a creative outlet quite like that which MUSE offers?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSo, I&#39;d like to thank all the forgotten editorial teams of Nouse and MUSE past, who have made the paper what it is now, and for providing us with this platform as well as so many editions that continue to be a source of humour and inspiration for the team.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis edition of MUSE holds a lot of strong opinions: the Film &amp;amp; TV team debate the success of Aesthetica Film Festival, the meaning of York&#39;s status as a human rights city is questioned, and a particularly scathing, but hilarious review of Muse&#39;s latest album (as in the American rock band and certainly not us) can be found in Music.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI hope that 20 years from now, the 2038 MUSE team will find inspiration from this edition, in the same way that I have while making it.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_infoBox\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_thumbnailCredit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_changelog\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null]}]]\\\\\\\&quot;]}],[0,{\\\\\\\&quot;articles_id\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,148257],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_categories\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;4,10\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_authors\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;2001\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_published\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\&quot;2019-01-22T20:12:54.000Z\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;editions_id\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_editionPage\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_updated\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\&quot;2019-01-24T14:25:33.000Z\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInLists\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInSearch\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInAdmin\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_type\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_slug\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;andrew-young-is-proud-of-his-muse-team\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_extraMetadata\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_thumbnail\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;276\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_lifetimeViews\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,126],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_archiveFallback\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_socialConfig\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;1,1,1,1\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_mediaCharterDone\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_socialExcerpt\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_dropCapital\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_displayImages\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_isThumbnailPortrait\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts\\\\\\\&quot;:[1,\\\\\\\&quot;[[0,{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,806718],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articles_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,148257],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_timestamp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;2019-01-24T14:26:33.000Z\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_userid\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,1],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_headline\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Andrew Young is proud of his MUSE team\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_excerpt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;A new Note from MUSE Editor Andrew Young\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_text\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&lt;div class=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;page\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;

The week starts with a biscuit. It ends with my health having decreased dramatically. As editors come and go in the office, the only constants that remain are the bourbon creams, my pink hoodie and a soundtrack that mixes ABBA, Ariana and lo-fi-hip-hop-chill-study-beats-mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late in the week comes the time for me to finally write this note. This one little column you are reading is one of the hardest things to decide on every edition, with my preparation largely consisting of saying &#39;Iâ€™ll do it later&#39; and Googling â€˜how to be funnyâ€™. Do I go for a comedic rant, risking the possibility I will get more eye-rolls than I will laughs? Or do I go a bit more serious, preaching in earnest about the state of the world? This time, Iâ€™d like to write about MUSE itself, and the hard work that goes into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Student media gets a bit of a kicking sometimes, particularly on social media. Yes, some of our news stories are local to Alan Partridge-esque levels (hello, duck density study in the last edition), but people love working on student media and, believe it or not, some people might actually read it. Even if nobody even opened a copy of MUSE, it would still be worthwhile, because Iâ€™ve had the time of my life editing it. Thatâ€™s not to say you shouldnâ€™t bother to open MUSE. You should. Itâ€™s great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular edition of MUSE has been a tricky but rewarding one, showcasing why student media is important. We have articles ruminating on cultural phenomena such as&amp;nbsp;Bandersnatch&amp;nbsp;and 2019â€™s emerging musical talent. We also have three Features articles on causes our writers care about. Jodie Sheehan shines a light on the work done by the York Neighbours charity; Seren Hughes opens up about mental health and how yoga can help combat it; Stella Newing and Malu Rocha discuss the increasing wealth of proper, three- dimensional female characters on our TV screens. This newspaper, like any, is far from perfect, but I am proud that it contains these articles, and proud that MUSE has given peo- ple the space to write about their passions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we can have a habit of shitting on other peopleâ€™s loves, hobbies and personali- ties. Itâ€™s something I have been guilty of myself, and something I have regretted. Itâ€™s a new year, so why not make it your resolution to do something&amp;nbsp;you&amp;nbsp;love and let others do what they love. As Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve noticed, in 2018 the world was filled with hate; we donâ€™t need it at our University too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_infoBox\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_thumbnailCredit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_changelog\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Updated

particularly difficult: my degree and social life have been neglected, while my dream of having a healthy sleep-schedule is laughable. Nevertheless, this edition might be my favourite yet as each team has really taken creative control over their respective section and the finished product is something that I am in-credibly proud of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Film &amp;amp; TV and Fashion have offered their takes on the upcoming Oscars, arguably my favourite event on the pop culture calendar. From around the age of 12, I would sneak downstairs to watch the Oscarsâ€™ Red-Carpet coverage live, desperate to catch every bea-tiful gown and potential interaction between the stars (a tradition I would sincerely regret come the Monday morning after having to frantically run to catch my 7:45 a.m. bus). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve often questioned the morality of my utter investment and engagement in such aspects of pop culture. Am I, as well as the entire concept of Hollywood, helplessly shallow? Admittedly, events such as the Oscars are intrinsically intertwined with masterpieces of cinema, of which, one would rarely doubt the artistic integrity. However, I am ashamed to admit that my obsession with pop culture often extends to social media and reality TV (god damn you Love Island). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before taking on the role of Deputy MUSE Editor, I was actually &lt;i&gt;Nouse&lt;/i&gt; Comment Editor, and that transition from &lt;i&gt;Nouse&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;to MUSE was quite severe. Not only did the nature of the content change drastically, but so did my interest in that content; with that fact came a little bit of guilt. Perhaps I should care less about Arianaâ€™s â€˜7 Ringsâ€™ (see Musicâ€™s some-what scathing critique on page 13), and spend more time trying to wrap my head around the chaos of Brexit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the longer I am part of MUSE, the more I realise that this guilt is misplaced. Arts, food, fashion and music are such fundamental aspects of both our individual lives and humanity as a whole. Itâ€™s what emotes us, gets us talking, inspires us, and thereâ€™s no shame in that. In fact, Iâ€™d argue that modern politics is far more shallow, superficial and fabricated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This edition we also have an insightful feature of the incredible organisation SASH, a charity that works with Yorkâ€™s homeless population, while in Food &amp;amp; Drink Alice Weetman offers an Ode to the Avocado. I hope that you enjoy this edition as much as I do, and that it can offer a form of guilt-free escapism after a very blue, Brexity

More than most, this editionâ€™s cover feature is something Iâ€™m very excited about. Last week I was lucky enough to have the privilege of interviewing one of my favourite stand-up comedians - the rather hilarious James Acaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our chat over the phone was insightful and enjoyable for me and I hope this has resulted in a great lead feature for this edition. My experience doing the interview has also led to me bringing it up in almost every conversation I have, letting half the population of York know that James Acaster â€œis a really nice guyâ€.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a more serious note, however, my brush with moderate celebrity has made me reflect on how fortunate I was to have the opportunity to do the interview. It is so helpful and so important that famous actors, singers, comedians and the like give their time to student journalists. For budding arts and culture writers like myself, interview experience is invaluable. To interview someone who next week features in&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;gives a huge confidence boost that could make a big difference to someone pursuing a career in journalism. It is also an opportunity that not everyone will realise a student newspaper offers. Do student media kids â€“ itâ€™s great!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opportunity to speak to and interact with people of any level of fame is also a useful exercise in breaking down our modern cultureâ€™s cult of celebrity. I recently watched the Fyre Festival documentary on Netflix about a super-fest gone wrong. What struck me was how shockingly influential Instagram celebs are on our spending habits. To remove the intense glorification of well-known individuals makes us a healthier society. While a stand-up from Kettering is hardly Kendall Jenner, the principle remains the same. Having a relaxed chat with someone I admire greatly has made me realise even more how daft our celebrity obsessions can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, enough of this huge ego-trip of mine: Fashion Week! For something genuinely impressive this month, look no further than the 16-page LFW supplement our mag- nificent Fashion and Shoot teams have put to- gether. They worked so hard and I am in awe of some of the beautiful designs they have put together. In the main body of MUSE, we have fascinating current affairs-based features and musings on a range of subjects, from modern romance on screen, to travelling as an au pair. Tastiest of all, of course, is our full-page review of the various food stalls at the terribly cool Spark* York.

class=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;column\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have now experienced my first year of YUSU elections and York certainly takes it seriously! Everywhere I turned I was faced with posters, my Facebook feed was filled with videos and I had a constant stream of emails reminding me to vote. As a voter, I felt I couldnâ€™t escape from the build-up, so I cannot imagine the intensity the candidates must have experienced as they campaigned in person, online and through all forms of media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since coming to university, I have genuinely felt like part of a community, however this election elevated it to a whole new level. I can honestly say it seems that the candidates campaigned harder than old Theresa May and Jezza Corbyn did in the last General Election. Perhaps our politicians should try enticing the nation to vote by also promising to reduce the price of alcohol by 10p per thousand votes? I really think it would be a winning tactic. The efforts made within the two weeks of campaigning were rather amazing, and at times I did want to remind candidates that they werenâ€™t going to be made Activities Officer of the Country, just of the York University bubble. I reached the point of promising to vote for anyone, I just wanted them to stop invading the RKC during dinner time and allow me to return my attention to my lasagne. Even our flat was invaded with personally written cards asking us to â€œVote Xâ€ that inevitably would end up being tossed in the bin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a moment the number of cardboard signs almost outnumbered the number of geese, as every pillar, tree and gate was embellished with signs battling for votes. I swear I overheard someone advising a candidate on the best tactics for â€œpinning a sign upâ€ and when god forbid someone covered your sign with theirs... this could only mean war. Candidates even managed to pop up in lectures, utilising the 20 seconds they each had available to plug their manifesto. One lecturer perhaps inadvertently shared his opinion of the candidates presented to him as he told the students that â€œthere are other candidates available.â€ He obviously felt the need to reassure the lecture hall not to worry, other candidates were avail- able, not all hope was lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;column\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt like I was transported to District 12 of the&amp;nbsp;Hunger Games&amp;nbsp;during my stint in the library on Friday afternoon when, as the clock struck three, James Durcanâ€™s voice boomed across the speaker, like President Snowâ€™s himself, reminding us all that only an hour of voting remained. The silence of the library had been broken, these elections must be important, it was time for me to vote. Ranking the candidates was a rather tiring task, I knew who I wanted to rank as first or second, but once it got to the fifth and sixth option I didnâ€™t really care anymore. Why couldnâ€™t we have just ticked one box? With the rest of the election campaign mirroring the general election, why couldnâ€™t voting have been as simple?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There does seem to be a divide on campus between those keen voters, who wholeheartedly believe that YUSU makes a difference, and those who question whether anyone actually cares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can only conclude by saying good luck to our new officers I hope they now exercise their manifestos with the rigorousness with which they removed their cardboard signsâ€“ we love their dedication to cleaning the campus. We raised an amazing Â£3000 for charity and reduced the price of campus pints â€“ epitomising what a community can achieve when it binds together. We can, however, all agree that we are secretly mourning the loss of a travelator between Fairhurst and Morrell, never knowing what direction it would have travelled in...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_infoBox\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_thumbnailCredit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_changelog\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_googleAppsUsernameYork\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_googleAppsUsernameNouse\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;andrew.young\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_name1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Andrew\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_name2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Young\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_userid\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,2001],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_created\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;2017-06-19T14:27:36.000Z\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_notes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_thumbnail\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;1003\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_changepass\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_deleted\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_suspended\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_facebook\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_twitter\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;andy_young_film\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_instagram\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_linkedin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;andrew-y-976375106\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_snapchat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_bio\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_archive_username\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Andrew

patriarchy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_text\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&lt;p&gt;Tales of romance and erotica have always been popular. The modern romance novel has some roots in the romantic fiction of the 18th and 19th centuries, with authors such as Jane Austen and Ann Radcliffe setting hearts aflutter. Following in their footsteps, the 20th century romance authors brought something different to the traditional tropes of the genre - sex. In the 1960s, D. H. Lawrenceâ€™s Lady Chatterleyâ€™s Lover was finally published after nearly 30 years and was quickly taken to court for its obscenity. Despite attempts by so-called moralists, Penguin Books won the case and quickly sold three million copies after the trial drummed up intrigue. The message was clear: romance and sex sells. The want for smut caused a shift in the publishing space and the stereotypical bodice rippers, that often get cheap digs for being the fodder for horny housewives, boomed into popularity during the 70s and 80s. Shortly after, the rom coms of the 90s and 00s made their way onto our screens but since, well, Twilight , the Hollywood machine has stopped churning out romance at the rate they once did.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, romance is a billion-dollar industry, with 23 percent of overall fiction novel sales going to romance in 2016. Since the pandemic, sales have rocketed by 49 percent. The pandemicâ€™s boost in sales is represented on an even wider scale with social media users on TikTok and Twitter making the romance fandom more active than ever. In fact, the Twilight franchise, that had seemingly killed off the genre in the mainstream, reignited the flames of passion. The Twilight renaissance took over timelines in 2020 and ever since romance (particularly smut) has been a hot topic on â€˜BookTokâ€™.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Despite its insane popularity, romance fiction still endures the stereotype of a guilty pleasure and the sneering of those who think themselves too good for the lovey-dovey genre. Obviously, the snobbery towards romance fiction is steeped in misogyny. Talia Hibbert, author of the series The Brown Sisters , told I-D that within â€œa patriarchal society that prioritises the idea that feelings are gross and embarrassing and stupid, a genre thatâ€™s entirely about feelings is always going to be looked down on.â€ Although there are very valid criticisms of the romance genre such as its long history with racism as well as its portrayals of abuse as love and rape as sex, these arenâ€™t the stories that are so popular at the moment. Stories led by queer, POC, overweight, and disabled protagonists are at the forefront, enabling romance to be a genre that teaches everyone that they are also capable of loving and being loved.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;At the same time, our social media feeds are flooded with videos of couples, both happy and unhappy. TikTok content focused on happy women in loving and fulfilling relationships with communicative and emotionally available partners is showing how possible it is to have the romance and intimacy that only feels tangible for some in the pages of a book. Equally, videos of women talking about their partnersâ€™ weaponised incompetence and inability to look after themselves are showing how possible it is to end up in unfulfilling and often at times hellish relationships with men. The pandemic has exposed lots of flaws within the heterosexual relationship dynamic and caused a spike in break-ups and divorces. The lull in life allowed people, mostly women, to see how much of the domestic and emotional labour, as well as child rearing, was left to them. Covid-19 created the perfect storm for couples on the rocks and, when paired with social media discourse of weaponised incompetence, it is not surprising that law firms logged a 122 percent increase of enquiries about divorce between July and October of 2020 alone.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;These pop culture happenings during the pandemic are contextualised by a background of social progression. This has led to a point where women no longer need marriage and, by proxy, a man to enable them to open bank accounts, buy homes or even have children. Women have been supporting themselves successfully for quite a few decades and the need for a man to â€˜supplyâ€™ has dramatically decreased. As a result, many women are looking around and seeing the potential for healthy relationships while reading romance novels that tell them â€˜happily ever afterâ€™ is possible. They have firmly decided men arenâ€™t worth the trouble unless they can contribute equally to the relationship, including domestic and emotional labour that has historically been left to women.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;It is easy to understand how the popularity of romance fiction, the positive displays of romantic and intimate relationships on social media and the progression of womenâ€™s rights have culminated in healthier and higher relationship expectations than ever before. In fact, according to Paul Dolan, a behavioural science expert at the London School of Economics, research has proven that the happiest and healthiest sub-group are unmarried, child-free women. Why would women give up a longer and better-quality life for an unfulfilling relationship? Only if the man met the standard would he be worth a few less years on the planet. In contrast, men are at higher risk of isolation if they donâ€™t get married as they make friends less easily and donâ€™t take part in as many social activities or community groups as women.

However, this has caused the chasm between men and women to widen. The independence expressed by women has been retaliated against by men and has left the majority of men in the dust. In particular, those who were raised with a lack of emotional intelligence and the mentality that all they offer is physical intimacy, protection and financial support.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The impact of psychological patriarchy is rampant and is deeply ingrained in all of us. In his book How can I get Through to You? Terrence Real explains that psychological patriarchy is a dynamic where human qualities are labelled masculine and feminine. Half of these human traits are revered (the masculine ones) whilst the other half are devalued (the feminine ones). Any traits that are viewed as feminine or feminine-leaning are mocked and beaten out of young boys and men by everyone. The way this division is taught does not, of course, add up to healthy relationships for adults. Naturally, the patriarchy and its adjacent structures donâ€™t care about healthy relationships, but those who are committed to breaking down these systems, should.

There is a certain level of vulnerability that comes with trying to be more emotionally intelligent and when society tells you that vulnerability is bad, it must be terrifying. Of course, not everyone can be helped; not every incel can be or wants to be saved, but feminism can bridge that gap and enable men to learn how to be better brothers, fathers, sons, and partners to the women in their lives. The teachings of feminism should be a place where men who are willing to do the work without being a burden to the emotional labour of women can come to better themselves.

It is a small step in breaking down a system that people are trying to escape from within a book.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Tales of romance and erotica have always been popular. The modern romance novel has some roots in the romantic fiction of the 18th and 19th centuries, with authors such as Jane Austen and Ann Radcliffe setting hearts aflutter. Following in their footsteps, the 20th century romance authors brought something different to the traditional tropes of the genre - sex. In the 1960s, D. H. Lawrenceâ€™s Lady Chatterleyâ€™s Lover was finally published after nearly 30 years and was quickly taken to court for its obscenity. Despite attempts by so-called moralists, Penguin Books won the case and quickly sold three million copies after the trial drummed up intrigue. The message was clear: romance and sex sells. The want for smut caused a shift in the publishing space and the stereotypical bodice rippers, that often get cheap digs for being the fodder for horny housewives, boomed into popularity during the 70s and 80s. Shortly after, the rom coms of the 90s and 00s made their way onto our screens but since, well, Twilight , the Hollywood machine has stopped churning out romance at the rate they once did.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNevertheless, romance is a billion-dollar industry, with 23 percent of overall fiction novel sales going to romance in 2016. Since the pandemic, sales have rocketed by 49 percent. The pandemicâ€™s boost in sales is represented on an even wider scale with social media users on TikTok and Twitter making the romance fandom more active than ever. In fact, the Twilight franchise, that had seemingly killed off the genre in the mainstream, reignited the flames of passion. The Twilight renaissance took over timelines in 2020 and ever since romance (particularly smut) has been a hot topic on â€˜BookTokâ€™.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDespite its insane popularity, romance fiction still endures the stereotype of a guilty pleasure and the sneering of those who think themselves too good for the lovey-dovey genre. Obviously, the snobbery towards romance fiction is steeped in misogyny. Talia Hibbert, author of the series The Brown Sisters , told I-D that within â€œa patriarchal society that prioritises the idea that feelings are gross and embarrassing and stupid, a genre thatâ€™s entirely about feelings is always going to be looked down on.â€ Although there are very valid criticisms of the romance genre such as its long history with racism as well as its portrayals of abuse as love and rape as sex, these arenâ€™t the stories that are so popular at the moment. Stories led by queer, POC, overweight, and disabled protagonists are at the forefront, enabling romance to be a genre that teaches everyone that they are also capable of loving and being loved.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAt the same time, our social media feeds are flooded with videos of couples, both happy and unhappy. TikTok content focused on happy women in loving and fulfilling relationships with communicative and emotionally available partners is showing how possible it is to have the romance and intimacy that only feels tangible for some in the pages of a book. Equally, videos of women talking about their partnersâ€™ weaponised incompetence and inability to look after themselves are showing how possible it is to end up in unfulfilling and often at times hellish relationships with men. The pandemic has exposed lots of flaws within the heterosexual relationship dynamic and caused a spike in break-ups and divorces. The lull in life allowed people, mostly women, to see how much of the domestic and emotional labour, as well as child rearing, was left to them. Covid-19 created the perfect storm for couples on the rocks and, when paired with social media discourse of weaponised incompetence, it is not surprising that law firms logged a 122 percent increase of enquiries about divorce between July and October of 2020 alone.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThese pop culture happenings during the pandemic are contextualised by a background of social progression.

in unveiling and spotlighting Black history, heritage, and art in Yorkshire, founded by Joe Williams. They work with local communities and aspiring artists, and their projects are aimed at people of all ages, with a common goal to empower and inform.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;According to their website, on the first Saturday of every month, Heritage Corner run guided Black History Walks around Leeds, where walkers are joined by a cast of historical figures that animate the cityâ€™s hidden narratives connected to ancient Africa and its history. The idea was devised by Williams in 2009 for the Leeds Bi-centenary Transformation Project, which commemorated the abolition of the 1807 Slave-Trade Act. From this, Heritage Corner was born in 2014, and has continued to make progress as a grassroots community, but also as an accredited academic institu - tion. The project is supported by the University of Leeds, Leeds Beckett University and Leeds Trinity University, so that on-campus history is not overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The walk itself transcends historical boundaries, beginning with a ponder upon the magnitude of the University of Leeds Parkinson Building, as walkers and teachers explore the influences and implications of the imposing Greek-revival architecture. The trail passes through Textile Court, allowing for an important recognition of cloth and botanical trade, as listeners dwell on the industryâ€™s complex and tyrannical histories. Walkers donâ€™t miss out on natural encounters either, as the tour does not exclude natureâ€™s beauty and history in its examinations of the city and campus. Observations on the relationship between man-made history and natural history can be made in tandem with a glance at the sculptural weavings of Mitzi Cunliffeâ€™s sculpture â€˜Man-Made Fibresâ€™ (1955). Ancient and contemporary histories are intertwined throughout. Past walkers quote the tour as â€œresplendent with characterâ€, â€œwell researchedâ€, and innovative in the use of performance and characterisation to â€œbring history to lifeâ€. Heritage Cornerâ€™s close and delicate focus on the cityâ€™s archi - tectural, literary and artistic histories is a triumph within itself when paired against consumerist and touristic city tours. But their unfeigned ingenuity is in â€˜active-learningâ€™ neglected history.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The walks are organised to foreground â€˜positive historyâ€™, which resonates as deeply important in a culture that has become desensitised to im - ages of brutality and pain, giving in to a history of cultural consumption of Black suffering as a spectacle or entertainment ([skindeepmag.com/ articles/black-pain-as-entertainment-suffering- spectacle-colonial-violence](skindeepmag.com/ articles/black-pain-as-entertainment-suffering- spectacle-colonial-violence)). Black and African presence in Yorkshire is told through stories that centre pioneers, leaders, and creatives, such as that of Nesyamun the Mummy found in Leeds Museum, Ethiopian royalty with connections to Queen Victoria, the Queen of Sheba, David Oluwale, Olaudah Equiano, or the Northern British Abolitionist Movement. In addition, the tours prove how powerful the arts are in teaching, understanding, and curating history. Re-telling factual histories through narrative reenactments allows for a reanimation of forgotten knowledge, and acts as a means of letting listeners create their own relationships to particular narratives through their experiences of the art in question.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Notably, Heritage Cornerâ€™s use of artistic conventions does not stop at reenactments or ventures into Art History, but includes the creation of poems, dances, and more.

Rheima Robinsonâ€™s poetic piece â€˜Black Is...â€™ exemplifies the artistic impact of the Leeds Black History Walk, as Robinson ex - presses: â€œwe are children of legacy, from those who gave gold to the poor, and traded salt from the seas that we owned, in the cities that we built. Black is... the keeper of knowledge.â€ When relaying her experience of the Leeds Black History Walk, Robinson states that â€œthe likelihood of history being passed on and shared through art feels more tangible and more genuine than a textbook.â€ This aligns with the commitment that the organisation has to change the stereotypes associated with the teaching of African History.

Show at the Grand Opera House, York.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_text\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&lt;p&gt;I am ashamed to admit that before seeing this show, I didnâ€™t know a lot about Cher (Iâ€™ll just give all the Cher fans out there a moment to recover). To me, Cher was just a singer with eccentric outfits, an unusually deep voice and Mamma Miaâ€™s newest opportunity to namedrop. I settled into my seat with a vague sense of imposter syndrome, as the people on either side of me excitedly regaled the experience of seeing Cher live, and waited for something â€“ I wasnâ€™t sure what â€“ to begin. Itâ€™s safe to say that I left the same theatre two and a half hours later considering myself a newly discovered Cher fan.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;As a dazzling tribute to the singer, actress and television personality, the musical doesnâ€™t disappoint. Any show that strives to represent someone so beloved and so recognisable faces many potential pitfalls; especially with an audience salivating over performances by the real Cher. How will the show remain true to her character? How will it prevent slipping into caricature or straying too far from the truth? The answer to these questions came in the form of not one, but three Chers. Initially I was sceptical of this choice. However, for an icon dubbed the â€˜Queen of Reinventionâ€™, it worked perfectly to demonstrate Cherâ€™s maturation over the course of her career.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The youngest Cher, played by Millie Oâ€™Connell and nicknamed â€˜Babeâ€™, encapsulated Cher in the 50s and 60s. With blue-painted eyelids and a youthful inability to sit still, Millie Oâ€™Connell managed to capture the wide-eyed innocence of a young Cher, desperate to be famous. Bullied in childhood for her Armenian genes, we watch as Cher grows from a shy, insecure child into an ambitious young adult, thanks to the guiding influence and high-heeled independence of her mother Georgia (played by Tori Scott).Â  I couldnâ€™t help but feel at times that the childish insecurity of Cher was overwrought; surely there was more to her childhood than lamenting bullies to her mother?Â  Then again, establishing Cher against this backdrop of abandonment (by the man she called â€˜fatherâ€™) and abuse (by her peers), explains her persistent infatuation with Sonny Bono (played by understudy, Guy Woolf) and some of the later insecurities that surface during the play.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;If Millie Oâ€™Connell is â€˜innocenceâ€™, then Danielle Steers playing Cher in the 70s is â€˜confidenceâ€™. She stormed her way onto the stage, clad in a variety of shimmering outfits with a voice that filled the theatre. This Cher, nicknamed â€˜Ladyâ€™, supplants the last and represents Cherâ€™s career on the Sonny &amp;amp; Cher Show, as a TV personality. However, behind the confident exterior, the false eyelashes and the fame, we become increasingly aware that â€˜Ladyâ€™sâ€™ life is not the dream it appears. The middle part of the show delicately vacillates between the highs and lows of the entertainment industry, careful not to glorify Cherâ€™s fame without acknowledging its risks. Danielle Steers movingly portrays Cherâ€™s gradual disillusionment with fame, as exhaustion descends. She tires of the unending cycle of performances; the return to her hotel room, removal of her makeup and repetition of the same routine the next day. Alongside this, her marriage crumbles and Cher seems progressively powerless on a stage dominated by men. The culmination of these pressures reaches its climax in a masterful performance of â€˜All I Ever Need is Youâ€™ in which Sonny and Cher argue behind the scenes, while singing a jaunty song for their viewers. Although ironic, this song also exposes the very real facade that is fame.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Debbie Kurup, known as â€˜Starâ€™, presented the 80s and 90s Cher and brought a refreshing maturity to the role. The concerns of the show shifted in the final section, pivoting away from fame towards Cherâ€™s personal life; her relationships after Sonny, her children and the reappearance of her mother. We watch as she tortuously tries to balance fame and privacy, ultimately being forced to confront the sacrifice that stardom demands; her freedom. As much as this revelation contributes a melancholic tone to the show, Cher is irrevocably bound to her career. From the moment she changed her name from Cherilyn to Cher and set her sights in the stars, Cher became an icon.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The show came to a majestic conclusion as all three Cherâ€™s returned for a powerful last song. Apparently endowed with every glittering accessory the costume designers could find, this song reminded the audience that her legacy maintains its shining allure. The audience demonstrated this with an eclectic combination of dance moves, hand clapping and attempts to sing along. Even after the curtain fell, the atmosphere did not subside and I found myself humming â€˜Believeâ€™ for days to come. Having all three Cherâ€™s contribute to this final mash-up illustrates that she is a culmination of her lifeâ€™s experiences; she is innocent, confident and mature. Every choice she makes, as is true of all people, is informed by all the iterations of herself. This show ultimately shows that no person is unchanging but equally we cannot escape from our pasts; we must accept and grow with every piece of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://nouse.co.uk/image/?f=6433&amp;amp;s=large&amp;amp;r=true\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; alt=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;6433\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;I am ashamed to admit that before seeing this show, I didnâ€™t know a lot about Cher (Iâ€™ll just give all the Cher fans out there a moment to recover).

over a plot summary of Agatha Christieâ€™s 1939 murder mystery novel a week prior to DramaSocâ€™s â€˜Fresherâ€™s playâ€™ didnâ€™t immediately pique my interest â€“ I knew I would be going to watch it, but I wasnâ€™t entirely convinced that I would enjoy it. However, Cerelia Chamberlain and Tommy Hainesâ€™ electric adaptation dispelled my worst fears; this was a far cry from the staid, overly serious dramatisation I was expecting. On paper, the storyline doesnâ€™t exactly lend itself to big laughs; ten strangers summoned to a remote island are rapidly killed off one by one.

Although I couldnâ€™t shake the feeling it was a little overdone at times (some of Lightâ€™s scenes could have benefitted from a slightly darker tone), the dramatic effect Chamberlain and Haines were striving for was never lost and Stapletonâ€™s mesmeric final performance convinced me Iâ€™d just sat through two hours of surprisingly impressive student theatre.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://nouse.co.uk/image/?f=6578&amp;amp;s=large&amp;amp;r=true\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; alt=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;6578\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Skimming over a plot summary of Agatha Christieâ€™s 1939 murder mystery novel a week prior to DramaSocâ€™s â€˜Fresherâ€™s playâ€™ didnâ€™t immediately pique my interest â€“ I knew I would be going to watch it, but I wasnâ€™t entirely convinced that I would enjoy it.

A city where the ashes of peopleâ€™s lives, blown across Italy, finally come to rest. Every character meanders across the pages, despite an acute awareness that â€œevery minute that passed was one less minute [...] to liveâ€, and reading the book is like entering that same suspension of time. Captivating from beginning to end, Gianfranco Calligarichâ€™s novel spins a beautiful, delicate web of memories and possibilities. This is a novel about words unspoken, experiences unlived and potential unfulfilled. It is about sex not had, and love never acknowledged. It gestures to â€˜last summerâ€™, an ambiguous past, and also describes an end; the â€˜last summerâ€™. For years this masterpiece of Italian literature has wavered in and out of the public eye, like someone dipping their toe into the sea before deciding itâ€™s too cold. At times garnering great critical acclaim and at others gathering dust on an empty bookshelf, Last Summer is as adrift and elusive as the story it contains.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Fermenting amidst a haze of cigarettes, sex and regret, the novelâ€™s protagonist, Leo Gazzara, can be found propped up against the side of a bar, book in hand. After countless nights spent with strange women, he soaks in the pleasure of a bath and lukewarm coffee before leaving their apartments forever. Evenings are a blur of alcohol-inspired escapades with his friend Graziano, and his days are occupied pursuing a failed career in journalism. Leo seems to scrape by on stolen peanuts from his rich friends&#39; parties and the little cash he has in his pockets. Steadfast through it all is his â€œold Alfa Romeoâ€. The car recurs as a reminder that, despite being able to travel somewhere else, Leo is perpetually stuck here amongst the fragments of his broken dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;That is, until he meets Arianna; equally lost, devastatingly beautiful, and almost always â€œhystericalâ€. Towards the beginning of the novel, they share an evening of picturesque moments, like movie stills from life. Warm brioches at three in the morning, Ariannaâ€™s red raincoat, and long conversations about books. These snippets replay like a broken record without ever going anywhere, always circling back to the same sense of incompatibility. Or rather, perfect compatibility, resulting in what Andre Aciman describes as a â€œterminally destructiveâ€ relationship. They are both equally unmoored and unable to articulate the one word that could change everything: love. It is not until the final pages that Arianna finally admits it: â€œâ€˜God, how I loved you,â€™ she said hoarsely. â€˜How I loved youâ€™â€.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Leo and Arianna love each other in the past tense, feeling nostalgic for something they never had. Like everything else in the novel â€“ time, family, friends, dreams â€“ Leoâ€™s only love slips through his fingers like grains of sand on the beach. Everything about them is incongruous. Even their language seems cosmically misaligned:&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;â€œâ€˜Itâ€™s starting to rain,â€™ I said.&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nâ€˜Youâ€™re sad,â€ she said. â€˜I can tell youâ€™re sad.â€™&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nâ€˜No,â€™ I said.&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nâ€˜How unlucky I am,â€™ she said.â€&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The meaning of these phrases eludes the reader, taunting us with unanswered questions and unfinished thoughts. Reading the conversations between Leo and Arianna is like hopping between stepping stones that keep growing further apart, desperately trying to string together a coherence which lingers just outside the pages of the book. It is frustrating and cryptic. It is love; but what does love mean when unspoken? It is the only thing that cannot be fixed in a city where â€œnothing is irreparableâ€.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Calligarichâ€™s stunning prose carries the reader on a journey through Romeâ€™s topography, irrevocably bound to the interior world of the characters. Each of them navigates a sepia-tinged world of bars, apartments, hotel rooms and villas which are drenched in the Italian sun. The striking disharmony between lyrical description and colloquial language blends beauty with the harsher realities of life; it gives voice to those bleak feelings which can only be expressed as â€œfucked-upâ€. Meanwhile, moments of poetry and music float through the text; the remains of an idealised life.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;One of the marginal notes I made while reading says â€œevery moment has a soundtrackâ€ and this whole novel is profoundly interested in musicality. Leo expresses that certain writers â€œought to be read aloudâ€; the rain speaks and â€œalways seems to be asking somethingâ€â€™, and Leo and Arianna lament their unrealised romance while listening â€œto the old songs of the previous yearâ€. The text, like a song, contains a refrain; â€œI was at the end of my tetherâ€. Despite this, Leoâ€™s story fills an entire novel and his â€˜tetherâ€™ is elongated by the sun-baked landscape of summer.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;I will conclude this review in the same way Calligarich concludes his novel, with the sea. A constant presence in the novel, the sea is a source of bliss and purification. The rhythm of the waves is a gentle marker of time passing, quietly and slowly, but perpetually. It is also a place of return, the beginning and end of a cycle. Leo â€œthink[s] that everything returns to the seaâ€, and although every character in this book is a different shade of loneliness, they are all subject to the shift of time and nature.

Sprawled across its sparse thumbnail are the words â€œNo Sleep For a Yearâ€, printed in a bold, yellow typeface. To their right, a bald man in a drab grey jumpsuit stares out at the viewer with tired, vapid eyes. His breast bears a patch with the word â€œHsiehâ€printed on it, an understated insignia that appears to have been ironed on. This man is Taiwanese performance artist Tehching (or Sam) Hsieh, photographed during his notorious Time Clock Piece (1980-81), and this video changed the way I look at art.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Hsieh was born in Taiwan in 1950. He moved to New York in 1974, after jumping ship during his stint as a sailor. During his first four years in New York, he worked as a dishwasher and cleaner. Not the most prolific start for an artist whose work would leave an indelible mark on the landscape of performance art just four short years later. Prior to this point, Hsiehâ€™s only work of note was his Jump Piece (1973), which he made in Taiwan shortly before emigrating to New York. In Jump Piece, Hsieh set up a camera to take a series of shots as he jumped out of a second-story window. He broke both of his ankles during the piece, and judging by the expression on his face after he hit the ground, it looks like it hurt. But even this is nothing compared to what Hsieh put himself through between 1978-84, when he undertook four year-long performance pieces: Cage Piece (1978-79), Time Clock Piece (1980-81), Outdoor Piece (1981-82), and Rope Piece (1983-84). The sparse amount of information about these pieces that is available on Wikipedia does not do justice to their ingenuity (or insanity), so in this article I will go through each in turn and give a brief account of Hsiehâ€™s artistic exploits.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The critical literature that is available on Cage Piece tends to characterise it as a precursor to Time Clock Piece, but despite this, it still stands on its own merits as an integral piece of performance art that gave New York its first taste of Tehching Hsieh. The premise of Cage Piece is simple: Hsieh locked himself inside a cage for an entire year. He did not speak, read, or write. He was entirely alone with his own thoughts and the sole human contact he received was a housemate who came once a day to feed him, remove his waste, and take a photograph to document the process. Once or twice a month the public were permitted access to view Hsieh in his cage, and a lawyer made a record of the whole process to ensure that Hsieh did not leave the cage prior to 30 September 1979, exactly one year after he first entered it. Why would anyone in their right mind want to do this? For Hsieh, art is an extension of the self. The hardships that he endured across his performance pieces evince how for him, art invariably involves an element of sacrifice. In Cage Piece Hsieh sacrificed not only his time, but also his physical and mental health, and this element of sacrifice is ultimately a common thread that weaves throughout his performance pieces. However, the depravity of Cage Piece is ultimately nothing compared to the physical and mental extremes that Hsieh endured in his next and most notorious performance piece, Time Clock Piece, a truly iconic and indelible work that expands upon the precedent Hsieh set in his earlier work.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Time Clock Piece reads like a depraved exercise in masochism that even the most seasoned insomniac would dread. Like in Cage Piece, Hsieh locked himself in a room for an entire year. To keep him occupied he challenged himself to punch a time clock once an hour (on the hour) for every hour of that year. There are 8,760 hours in your average year, and for 8,627 of them, Hsieh punched the time clock. This is even more impressive a feat when you realise that Hsieh would not have slept for over an hour at a time all year, as he had to wake up once every hour to punch the time clock. In both Cage Piece and Time Clock Piece, Hsieh documented the entire process through a series of photographs. Each time that he punched the titular time clock, it would trigger a camera that had been rigged up to take his photograph. The 8,000+ photographs it took over the course of the year were edited into a short video in which each frame of the video corresponds to an hour of Hsiehâ€™s time. This piece was exhibited at the Tate Modern in 2017. One of my biggest regrets in life is being 16 at the time and not interested enough to go and see it.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;For his Outside Piece, Hsieh expanded his horizons and decided to try his hand at living outside for an entire year. He was, for all intents and purposes, homeless, but with the added constraint that he could not even enter a building. He kept this up for the entire year (with the exception of when he was arrested), living out of a backpack and sleeping bag. This was in New York, where temperatures regularly drop below 0Â°C in the winter and Hsieh was subject to the added surprise of a blizzard that hit the city in the spring of 1982, during which temperatures dropped below -6Â°C. For shelter, he slept under bridges and in garbage cans.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Rope Piece was Hsiehâ€™s penultimate performance piece, and once again he decided to push himself to the extremes. For an entire year Hsieh tied himself (with a rope) to fellow performance artist Linda Montano. They could not touch each other during this period, and were never separated: they ate, slept, and bathed together, their only privacy being the eight feet of rope between them. They spent every hour of every day together during this year. Time Clock Piece is likely to fuel the nightmares of an insomniac, but Rope Piece is bound to do the same to an introvert. No matter how much I liked someone, I doubt I could spend an entire year in their presence, and as with all of these pieces I have a huge amount of respect for the physical and mental resilience that Hsieh demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Since Rope Piece, Hsieh has created two more performance pieces of note. For his last one-year piece, No Art Piece (1985-86), Hsieh abstained from any activity that pertained to art. He did not create art, talk about art, read about art, or view art. Further to this, Hsieh then undertook a 13-year long â€˜pieceâ€™ between 1986 and 1999 in which he made art, but did not exhibit it. The artistic status of these pieces is more tentative than that of his other performance pieces, and I would argue that these are his weakest works. In spite of this, I still have a huge amount of respect for the man. Even in both of these pieces his work still challenges the viewer to re-evaluate their definition of art, and his ingenious and insane ideas are transgressive in a way that is unrivalled since Marcel Duchampâ€™s iconic Fountain (1917). Hsieh is a pioneer of performance art, and his work encourages us to contemplate not only the constraints that dictate what art is, but also what art means to us as individuals. I hope that this article can introduce others to his work. If youâ€™re ever in New York, drop by Clinton Hill, Brooklyn where, rumour has it, Hsieh currently runs a grocery store. Perhaps the pale, tepid Taiwanese pensioner behind the counter has a story or two he could tell you, if youâ€™re willing to listen.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Last March, a video titled â€˜The Insanity Artistâ€™ was uploaded to YouTube. Sprawled across its sparse thumbnail are the words â€œNo Sleep For a Yearâ€, printed in a bold, yellow typeface. To their right, a bald man in a drab grey jumpsuit stares out at the viewer with tired, vapid eyes. His breast bears a patch with the word â€œHsiehâ€printed on it, an understated insignia that appears to have been ironed on. This man is Taiwanese performance artist Tehching (or Sam) Hsieh, photographed during his notorious Time Clock Piece (1980-81), and this video changed the way I look at art.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHsieh was born in Taiwan in 1950. He moved to New York in 1974, after jumping ship during his stint as a sailor. During his first four years in New York, he worked as a dishwasher and cleaner. Not the most prolific start for an artist whose work would leave an indelible mark on the landscape of performance art just four short years later. Prior to this point, Hsiehâ€™s only work of note was his Jump Piece (1973), which he made in Taiwan shortly before emigrating to New York. In Jump Piece, Hsieh set up a camera to take a series of shots as he jumped out of a second-story window. He broke both of his ankles during the piece, and judging by the expression on his face after he hit the ground, it looks like it hurt. But even this is nothing compared to what Hsieh put himself through between 1978-84, when he undertook four year-long performance pieces: Cage Piece (1978-79), Time Clock Piece (1980-81), Outdoor Piece (1981-82), and Rope Piece (1983-84). The sparse amount of information about these pieces that is available on Wikipedia does not do justice to their ingenuity (or insanity), so in this article I will go through each in turn and give a brief account of Hsiehâ€™s artistic exploits.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe critical literature that is available on Cage Piece tends to characterise it as a precursor to Time Clock Piece, but despite this, it still stands on its own merits as an integral piece of performance art that gave New York its first taste of Tehching Hsieh. The premise of Cage Piece is simple: Hsieh locked himself inside a cage for an entire year. He did not speak, read, or write. He was entirely alone with his own thoughts and the sole human contact he received was a housemate who came once a day to feed him, remove his waste, and take a photograph to document the process. Once or twice a month the public were permitted access to view Hsieh in his cage, and a lawyer made a record of the whole process to ensure that Hsieh did not leave the cage prior to 30 September 1979, exactly one year after he first entered it. Why would anyone in their right mind want to do this? For Hsieh, art is an extension of the self. The hardships that he endured across his performance pieces evince how for him, art invariably involves an element of sacrifice. In Cage Piece Hsieh sacrificed not only his time, but also his physical and mental health, and this element of sacrifice is ultimately a common thread that weaves throughout his performance pieces. However, the depravity of Cage Piece is ultimately nothing compared to the physical and mental extremes that Hsieh endured in his next and most notorious performance piece, Time Clock Piece, a truly iconic and indelible work that expands upon the precedent Hsieh set in his earlier work.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTime Clock Piece reads like a depraved exercise in masochism that even the most seasoned insomniac would dread. Like in Cage Piece, Hsieh locked himself in a room for an entire year. To keep him occupied he challenged himself to punch a time clock once an hour (on the hour) for every hour of that year. There are 8,760 hours in your average year, and for 8,627 of them, Hsieh punched the time clock. This is even more impressive a feat when you realise that Hsieh would not have slept for over an hour at a time all year, as he had to wake up once every hour to punch the time clock. In both Cage Piece and Time Clock Piece, Hsieh documented the entire process through a series of photographs. Each time that he punched the titular time clock, it would trigger a camera that had been rigged up to take his photograph. The 8,000+ photographs it took over the course of the year were edited into a short video in which each frame of the video corresponds to an hour of Hsiehâ€™s time. This piece was exhibited at the Tate Modern in 2017. One of my biggest regrets in life is being 16 at the time and not interested enough to go and see it.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFor his Outside Piece, Hsieh expanded his horizons and decided to try his hand at living outside for an entire year. He was, for all intents and purposes, homeless, but with the added constraint that he could not even enter a building. He kept this up for the entire year (with the exception of when he was arrested), living out of a backpack and sleeping bag. This was in New York, where temperatures regularly drop below 0Â°C in the winter and Hsieh was subject to the added surprise of a blizzard that hit the city in the spring of 1982, during which temperatures dropped below -6Â°C. For shelter, he slept under bridges and in garbage cans.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nRope Piece was Hsiehâ€™s penultimate performance piece, and once again he decided to push himself to the extremes. For an entire year Hsieh tied himself (with a rope) to fellow performance artist Linda Montano. They could not touch each other during this period, and were never separated: they ate, slept, and bathed together, their only privacy being the eight feet of rope between them. They spent every hour of every day together during this year. Time Clock Piece is likely to fuel the nightmares of an insomniac, but Rope Piece is bound to do the same to an introvert. No matter how much I liked someone, I doubt I could spend an entire year in their presence, and as with all of these pieces I have a huge amount of respect for the physical and mental resilience that Hsieh demonstrated.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSince Rope Piece, Hsieh has created two more performance pieces of note. For his last one-year piece, No Art Piece (1985-86), Hsieh abstained from any activity that pertained to art. He did not create art, talk about art, read about art, or view art. Further to this, Hsieh then undertook a 13-year long â€˜pieceâ€™ between 1986 and 1999 in which he made art, but did not exhibit it. The artistic status of these pieces is more tentative than that of his other performance pieces, and I would argue that these are his weakest works. In spite of this, I still have a huge amount of respect for the man. Even in both of these pieces his work still challenges the viewer to re-evaluate their definition of art, and his ingenious and insane ideas are transgressive in a way that is unrivalled since Marcel Duchampâ€™s iconic Fountain (1917).

The Beatles with the remaster of their iconic album, Revolver\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_text\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&lt;p&gt;In 1966, The Beatles released &lt;em&gt;Revolver&lt;/em&gt;, an album which would fundamentally transform the musical landscape and assist the creation of a new counterculture. This album polarised The Beatles from other bands at the time, with an immense following that firmly cemented them as one of Britainâ€™s best bands - a true musical force. Before then, there was little to ensure their legacy as the timeless band which they became, since they were still playing a distinctively â€˜60â€™sâ€™ style of rock and roll. 24 songs off of their last six LPs had been covers, and their work to truly innovate this period was small, sticking largely to tried-and-tested blues, skiffle and â€˜rock and rollâ€™ formats. All of these had been pioneered in the 50s, particularly by Little Richard and Chuck Berry. The â€˜rock and rollâ€™ lifestyle took its toll, and in late 1966 the group were burned out from constant touring. They made the decision to stop touring and focus on making music as studio experimentation, as opposed to writing music for a live audience. This enabled them to curate their own sounds without mainstream media intervention and the demands of fans.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;With the new focus purely on the listening experience, a remix of &lt;em&gt;Revolver&lt;/em&gt; has been long overdue to bring the sound up to date with modern production standards. Son of the legendary Beatles Producer, Giles Martin followed his fatherâ€™s footsteps (George Martin) to utilise new AI technology and create a stereo mix of the classic mono album. This was released on 28 October 2022, in light of such technology that analyses the sound of the original song and creates individual tracks for each instrument. Later this can be remixed and remastered individually to create a fuller sound. The introduction of AI technology into music will also raise the exciting possibility of remixes for other classic mono albums, as well as providing an unprecedented opportunity for DJs and MCs to sample new tracks.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Upon initial listening, one might be mistaken for wondering what all the fuss is about- especially with the eye-watering price of Â£170 for the Super Deluxe vinyl! When compared to the 1966 mono tracks, however, the difference in sound quality is noticeable and proves a game-changer. In the age of streaming, potential fans may struggle to get into the band due to poor sound quality on early albums, and so this remix aims to address this issue and modernise their sound. The remix is truly the definitive version of &lt;em&gt;Revolver&lt;/em&gt;, one that holds its own with modern production techniques to create a richly textured sound and an immersive experience for listeners to â€œturn off your mind, relax and float downstreamâ€.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The shift to focussing on the studio sound also enabled the group to be more experimental with their music. The influence of George Harrison on this album cannot be understated, as well as the bandâ€™s new drug habits (especially their use of psychedelics). This crossover between Harrisonâ€™s fascination with Indian musical techniques (the Raga and the Sitar) and psychedelics helped create the trance-like style of â€˜Love You Toâ€™ and â€˜Tomorrow Never Knowsâ€™. These songs helped to raise the status of psychedelic rock and establish it well and truly in the mainstream, providing a soundtrack to the â€˜peace and loveâ€™ youth countercultures of the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;This was probably the peak of Harrisonâ€™s contribution to The Beatles as well, writing three songs and playing a central role for the majority of the album; almost all of which is guitar-centred, as opposed to their later piano/keyboard-focused work. Harrison, who never traditionally got the attention or praise that Lennon or McCartney did, is now starting to get the recognition he deserves. He is now a popular choice for peopleâ€™s favourite Beatle, one whose creative potential was recognised too late. &lt;em&gt;Revolver&lt;/em&gt; has led Harrison fans to dream about what the Beatles could have been had Harrison not been side-lined as a songwriter by his ever more competitive bandmates.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Harrison had some success as a songwriter, especially with his debut solo album, All Things Must Pass. However, it was clear that, as with the other Beatles, they were greater than the sum of their parts. A fact vividly highlighted by Paul McCartney in his recent Glastonbury performance, speaking in front of an audience of over 100,000 eager revellers and to countless more on video, was â€œWhen we do a Beatles song, all your phones light up and itâ€™s like a galaxy of stars. When we do a new song, itâ€™s like a black hole!â€ And so, it was with Harrison. Fellow Harrison-enthusiasts have grudgingly acknowledged that Harrison needed The Beatles as much as The Beatles needed Harrison. &lt;em&gt;Revolver&lt;/em&gt; provides the closest we have to a truly collaborative album between the Fab Four and, quite frankly, is all the better for it.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;In 1966, The Beatles released *Revolver*, an album which would fundamentally transform the musical landscape and assist the creation of a new counterculture.

It is the Manchester-based pop groupâ€™s specialty, as demonstrated in their previous albums - the societal failures highlighted in â€˜Love It If We Made Itâ€™ (&lt;em&gt;A Brief Enquiry into Online Relationships&lt;/em&gt;). â€˜Love It If We Made Itâ€™ was written with the influence of a barrage of headlines demonstrating the negative state of humanity. The song discusses controversial topics like the death of young Syrian refugees or Donald Trumpâ€™s (President at the time) derogatory comments regarding women. The bandâ€™s tracks which comment on the modern world around them connect with their audienceâ€™s feelings about the future, whether it be fear or optimism, and these songs are what give The 1975 their defining feature. Unsurprisingly, Being Funny in a Foreign Language does not disappoint, and a number of tracks continue this theme.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The album opens with the self-titled song â€˜The 1975â€™, although it does not follow the same pattern as the first three albumsâ€™ opening tracks (a new version of the same song). On &lt;em&gt;Being Funny in a Foreign Language&lt;/em&gt;, the band return to their strengths of self-reflective lyricism with which many fans and listeners can identify. Matt Healy discusses â€œscrolling through hellâ€, which many young people find themselves doing, with a seemingly infinite availability of online content on platforms such as Instagram or TikTok. The song also references Healyâ€™s own struggles with substance abuse, and its influence on the bandâ€™s past work: â€œYouâ€™re making an aesthetic out of not doing wellâ€. This â€˜aestheticâ€™ is referential of both their self-titled album and &lt;em&gt;I Like It When You Sleep For You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware Of It&lt;/em&gt;, on which both the tracks and the tours of each album reflected. Yet this also references the glorified â€˜Tumblr Eraâ€™ of negatively oversharing to strangers on the internet about personal struggles with mental health. For many listeners, Healy has shared their troubles with mental health related issues, and is able to express these shared experiences in the bandâ€™s music.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;In this album, lead singer Matty Healy and drummer George Daniel are joined in production by Jack Antonoff - potentially the biggest name in pop production currently. He has worked with Taylor Swift, Lorde, and Lana Del Rey (amongst others), as well as being in his own band, Bleachers. His talents seem to be endless, being able to play guitar, piano, drums, and providing vocals, as well as his abilities as a songwriter and producer. His addition into the production of &lt;em&gt;Being Funny in a Foreign Language&lt;/em&gt; takes the already excellent skills of Healy and Daniel and enhances them to create a cohesive and meaningful album.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The albumâ€™s third track â€˜Looking for Somebody (To Love)â€™ is a discussion of the negative repercussions of the modern conception of masculinity. Despite the songâ€™s upbeat feel and catchy tune, the track is about school shootings - something which Healy says is an â€œabstract phenomenaâ€ that as a British person he does not understand. The rise of Incel culture and the harm and violence which can be caused by men who are turned down by women is a key theme of â€˜Looking for Somebody (To Love)â€™: â€œYou should havÐµ seen how they ran when I was lookin&#39; for somebody to love/You should have seen it man, I was all bang, bang, bang, bang/Lookin&#39; for somebody to loveâ€. The song is completely relevant, as by the end of October 2022, there have been over 250 on-campus shootings at schools in America. The 1975 have always been politically aware, and this track is no different.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the most popular songs from the album already, â€˜About Youâ€™ features guitarist Adam Hannâ€™s wife Carly Holt. Holtâ€™s voice beautifully contrasts Healy in the track, which is a continuation of their 2013 single â€˜Robbersâ€™, an exploration of toxic relationships. It is for this reason that the track has gained such popularity amongst fans of The 1975. The track feels like a release from the relationship, despite both partiesâ€™ obvious longing for each other. The characters recognise their relationship was unhealthy, yet â€œhold on and hope that weâ€™ll find our way back in the endâ€. The song is a story about the desperate feelings of love, how it can confuse a person into thinking their partner was right for them, and how, even after breaking up, those feelings of â€˜loveâ€™ continue to linger.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;In â€˜About Youâ€™, Healy repeats the line, â€œDo you think I have forgotten about you?â€. Considering the success of this album, both in the charts and amongst fans, it is highly unlikely that The 1975 will be forgotten anytime soon. The band have been releasing exceptional songs since their pre-The 1975 days, such as in their prior band named Drive Like I Do in the early 2000s - their history is clearly promising for the future. The 1975 do not seem to be stopping any time soon, and despite &lt;em&gt;Being Funny in a Foreign Language&lt;/em&gt; only having been released in October, I am excited and eager to see what they do next, and to watch their music continue to get better and better.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being Funny in a Foreign Language&lt;/em&gt; reached the top of the UK album charts after its release on 14th October 2022. It is their fifth consecutive number one album, an impressive feat which clearly highlights the bandâ€™s continual success with each release of new music. The UK and Ireland stretch of their tour, &lt;em&gt;The 1975: At their Very Best&lt;/em&gt;, begins in January 2023, and if their new album is anything to go by, it is likely to be their best tour yet.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;The 1975 are back with their fifth studio album and, once again, it is an exceptional commentary on modern life. It is the Manchester-based pop groupâ€™s specialty, as demonstrated in their previous albums - the societal failures highlighted in â€˜Love It If We Made Itâ€™ (*A Brief Enquiry into Online Relationships*). â€˜Love It If We Made Itâ€™ was written with the influence of a barrage of headlines demonstrating the negative state of humanity. The song discusses controversial topics like the death of young Syrian refugees or Donald Trumpâ€™s (President at the time) derogatory comments regarding women. The bandâ€™s tracks which comment on the modern world around them connect with their audienceâ€™s feelings about the future, whether it be fear or optimism, and these songs are what give The 1975 their defining feature.

I was mesmerised. Her voice, the lyrics, the sound, and the energy she created in the room were awe-inducing. The way she moved and danced to the music, as though her body was carried by the sounds coming from her mouth, was proof that her songs were powerful. It had the same effect on the audience in 2022, just as it did in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Rogers first became famous when a video circulated online of Pharrell Williams visiting her music class and hearing her play â€˜Alaskaâ€™, to which he reacted with great joy, saying â€œIâ€™ve never heard anyone like you beforeâ€. â€˜Alaskaâ€™ was subsequently released in her first EP in 2017 and has gone on to become one of her most popular and recognisable songs.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Ahead of her album release this year, one of her singles made it to Barack Obamaâ€™s yearly summer playlist, with him including â€˜Thatâ€™s Where I Amâ€™. In response to this, she tweeted â€œrespectfully, i love uâ€. Her most recent album, &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt;, was released in July 2022, after great anticipation of her releasing three very powerful singles (â€˜Horsesâ€™, â€˜Want Wantâ€™ and â€˜Thatâ€™s Where I Amâ€™). Rogers also worked with Florence Welch (Florence + The Machine) on one of the tracks in the album. In â€˜Shatterâ€™, Florence can be heard singing in the background and playing the tambourine. Rogers also did backing vocals in â€˜Girls Against Godâ€™ and â€˜Dream Girl Evilâ€™ for Welch. Both Florence Welch and Maggie Rogers have the incredible power to create deeply meaningful and evocative songs, so them working together seems instinctive. Maggie Rogersâ€™ music was just that on the Friday I saw her live again.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;She opened with â€˜Overdriveâ€™, as she sauntered on stage in her trophy-gold top. This shocked me as for the other three nights sheâ€™d played so far, sheâ€™d worn white: a symbol of &lt;em&gt;Surrender&lt;/em&gt;, and I had assumed that she would continue this trend for the rest of the tour.Previously, sheâ€™d asked people attending one of her gigs in July to wear white, since it â€œrepresents a willingness to give in or let goâ€ and that is what her album was about. So, I stood near the stage in a white shirt in a sea of other people also wearing white garments. Maggie Rogers fans evidently obey her every word.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The stage was adorned with white flowers, in little clusters. There was also a red Turkish rug on the stage floor. Even the atmosphere of the stage is curated to symbolise surrender and to harbour positive energy. When she sang the opening lines to â€˜Alaskaâ€™, the crowd suddenly fell silent; there was no music to help them immediately recognise the song. She forced us to listen. To be peaceful for a moment, to let our brains recognise the lyrics. It was beautiful and ethereal, much like the song. When I saw her perform it in 2018, she was swaying and dancing to the music, with her mousey-brown hair flowing along. The song is about moving on from a breakup in Alaska and in it she sings, â€œcut my hair so I could rock back and forth, without thinking of youâ€. Maggie Rogers cut her hair in 2020, telling &lt;em&gt;Fashion Magazine&lt;/em&gt; â€œevery time I get my hair cut, I feel a sense of rebirthâ€¦ hair cuts are spiritual, and you get to remove parts of you that youâ€™ve been carrying for a long timeâ€. So when she sang â€˜Alaskaâ€™ in 2022, her hair wasnâ€™t dancing along with her, perhaps a symbol that she has stopped clinging to the past, and is instead â€˜surrenderingâ€™ to the future.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;With every single song, no one in the audience had any doubt that she was giving it her all:, Rogers was singing her lungs out. When she performed â€˜Want Wantâ€™, a song about passion and desire, she hung onto every single note. The audience were entranced â€“ you could feel the emotion in her voice with every word; no one could deny that she felt every single word she was saying. Her gigs feel almost like an emotionally cleansing party, as she jarred between songs about loneliness and heartbreak to songs about love, happiness and friendship. No matter what the song was about, she still danced to it, causing the crowd to dance with her. When she spoke between songs, she said to the crowd, â€œItâ€™s Friday night, let loose, dance!â€, and at one point she asked the people sitting down on the balcony above to stand up if they were able, encouraging them to dance and have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;It all concluded, and the party stopped with â€˜Different Kind of Worldâ€™. Maggie sung, still, whilst playing her guitar, and the crowd listened, focusing and holding onto every word she sung. It opens with â€œone last song, Iâ€™ll sing a song and make it a song for peaceâ€. With Ukraine at the forefront of everybodyâ€™s minds, these words only held more weight. The song continues with â€œmy knees are aching, back is breaking thinking â€˜bout the state of the world/ When weâ€™re riding all together, itâ€™s a different kind of worldâ€, and the audience were totally silent. I could sense some people around me were crying. When sheâ€™d finished the song, she looked into the crowd and told us, â€œWhenever you watch the news and feel overwhelmed, helpless and upset, just remember that this [the gig] existsâ€. Which seemed to give the audience hope, because â€œWhen weâ€™re riding all together, itâ€™s a different kind of worldâ€.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;When the lights came on after the gig, it revealed mascara-smudged faces. Yet, the venue began to play upbeat pop music, which some people began to dance joyfully to, as they let go of the sadness. One of Maggie Rogersâ€™ photographers came onto the floor and began to film some of them, perhaps to show to her, or for social media. Either way, I think Rogers sees the proof that her music is powerful and impassioned as she looks at the audience when sheâ€™s singing. The proof was all around me in the crowd. Maggie Rogers is a force to be reckoned with, her lyrics and voice evoke emotions from deep within her fans and brings them all out at her gigs. Itâ€™s clear she will continue to grow in popularity and that her fans are devoted to her music. â€˜Feral Joyâ€™ is what she wished to conjure in listeners with her new album. Sheâ€™s shown people why itâ€™s urgently needed, told them how to go after it, and displayed to them what it looks like. Her gig couldnâ€™t have been more successfully executed.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;I first saw Maggie Rogers live when she was supporting HAIM on their *Sister Sister Sister* tour back in 2018, at Alexandra Palace.

But for me, my favourite holiday is Spotify Wrapped Day.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Launched in 2016, Spotify Wrapped, which usually comes out at the start of December, not only curates a playlist of the top 100 songs you listened to that year, but also breaks down which songs you have listened to the most, your top five artists of the year, and your favourite music genres. Maybe itâ€™s my inherently nerdy side, but I revel in having my entire personality broken down into neat statistics.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Last year, the â€˜Wrappedâ€™ stories included a quiz about your personal music habits; shamefully, I got my own question wrong, whilst my friends proved that they know more about me than I do myself. This year, they have created a Myers Briggs-esque â€˜Listening Personalityâ€™, where the listening habits of Spotify users are analysed on whether they prefer Familiarity or Exploration, Timelessness or Newness, Loyalty or Variety, and Commonality or Uniqueness. As an â€˜ENVUâ€™, I am apparently â€˜The Adventurerâ€™: â€˜a seeker of soundâ€™ who â€˜ventures out into the unknownâ€™ searching for â€˜gems yet to be found.â€™ Whether or not this is true is debatable, but somehow it makes me feel seen, and plays into my deep-rooted individuality complex. Similarly, I canâ€™t help but get a kick out of knowing that I played music more than 96% of other listeners in the UK, or that I am in the top 1% of Taylor Swift listeners this year.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The brilliance of â€˜Wrappedâ€™, however, lies in its ability to bring people together. As soon as the â€˜Storiesâ€™ came out, my housemates and I started comparing notes, finding out if we had any of the same top artists, seeing who listened to the most music this year and listening to each otherâ€™s favourite songs. The last page of my â€˜Wrapped Storiesâ€™ which gives a neat summary of your top five songs and top five artists, along with your total â€˜minutes listenedâ€™ and top genre of music, was shared widely amongst my closest friends. Likewise, I revelled in getting theirs back; an intricate snapshot into the depths of their personalities.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The concept itself is a clever marketing tactic, designed to be shared and create a culture of FOMO for non-Spotify users. Although other music streaming services, such as Deezer and Apple Music, have tried to emulate â€˜Spotify Wrappedâ€™ to capitalise in on the hype, their seasonal recaps just donâ€™t generate the same buzz and excitement. Itâ€™s genius really; instead of worrying about how much data Spotify is collecting off of us, we look forward to having our personal information splayed across colourful imagery, desperate to dissect its analysis and share it with friends.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Statistics aside, I also love the fact that I can listen again and again to my favourite songs of the year. Although I often enjoy listening to new songs or shuffling through random playlists (naturally, due to my â€˜ENVUâ€™ personality), sometimes there is nothing more comforting than putting on a playlist where you know you love every single song. This is exactly what Spotify has created through the â€˜Top Songsâ€™ playlist. As an eternal Spotify user, I find it comforting to go back and look at all my â€˜Top Songsâ€™ playlists since 2016. I can literally see, through my music taste, the development of my personality and how much it has changed (or not) throughout my life. There will always be the same classics on there for 7 years running, but I find it particularly fascinating to literally be able to pin down the year that I got really into that one specific indie band.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Looking through my old playlists also helps uncover long forgotten memories, elements of my personality I havenâ€™t seen in years. For me, playlists serve as time-capsules for specific moments in my life. Putting one on can literally take me back to that time, to a version of myself that no longer exists. In times of stress, solace can be found through my past favourite songs; it allows me to reminisce about the times when my biggest worry was my Year 10 exams. Listening to these songs, those playlists, helps me to rediscover the experiences that have helped to shape me into the person I am today.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;I personally believe you can tell a lot about someone from their Spotify. Most people, when they are tasked with doing the background check on a friendâ€™s potential new suitor, do the cursory Facebook and Instagram stalk. I, however, like to go much deeper: the Spotify check. Although playlists do not equal compatibility, I believe that someoneâ€™s music taste is a window into their soul. On social media, people can curate themselves to a particular image they want to project. What they listen to, however, reveals hidden bits of their personality that you might not suspect. That rugby lad who is in every Salvos Wednesday with the boys? Turns out he actually loves Dua Lipa. That emo girl who only wears black and listens to grunge? Might have a bit of a soft spot for Take That. Although I like to think of myself as indie and underground, somewhat different to the crowd, my Spotify all but shatters this illusion. It reveals that, under the faÃ§ade, I am exactly like everyone else, and I just really love Taylor Swift.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;As well as allowing me to achieve ultimate self-awareness, Spotify also helps me to connect with my friends. As someone who is eternally unreachable through social media, I love checking on my friendâ€™s profiles, exploring to see if they have made any new playlists, or looking at what they are currently listening to from the sidebar on Spotify Web. Based on what they are playing, I can tell their mood, or guess what they are up to, making me feel more connected to their lives. Itâ€™s not a psychic connection that makes me send that â€˜are you okay?â€™ text at exactly the right time, itâ€™s because Iâ€™ve seen them listening to â€˜Songs To Cry Toâ€™ for the past hour.Â  Similarly, my friends have often commented that they can guess what I am up to based on what Iâ€™m listening to; if itâ€™s â€˜Peaceful Pianoâ€™ I will be doing my readings, or if itâ€™s throwback hits from 2010, Iâ€™ll be getting ready to go out.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;However, for the upcoming weeks, thereâ€™s only one playlist that Iâ€™ll have on repeat, and thatâ€™s my â€˜Top Songs 2022â€™.

Once in a while, however, you may find yourself attending a show that will soon become etched in the musical canon. Perhaps itâ€™s too soon to say, but Yard Actâ€™s homecoming show at their â€œsecond homeâ€, the Brudenell Social Club, certainly felt like one of them. Hot off their release of their much-lauded debut album &lt;em&gt;The Overload&lt;/em&gt;, the Leeds post-punk four-piece delivered a set that would please anyone: from the singerâ€™s bigoted alter-ego Graeme to the mullet-sporting upstarts that he so despises. Both demographics were out in force as we brushed shoulders with IPA-drinking Radio 6 dads to find a spot in the packed, sweaty crowd.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Support act (and labelmates) Baba Ali prepared the stage with infectious, analogue synth anthems, almost reminiscent of a â€˜Being Boiledâ€™-era Human League. The titular frontman brought a charismatic presence, grooving with his mic stand over the bodied, primal tones of a silent boiler-suited keyboardist. Comparisons to LCD Soundsystem abounded. We highly recommend you check out their latest album &lt;em&gt;Memory Device&lt;/em&gt;, to get a taste for yourself. As Yard Actâ€™s arrival approached, the crowd seemed to be steadily flooded with more and more Graeme-types. Anticipation peaked with opening tones of Fatboy Slimâ€™s â€˜Right Here, Right Nowâ€™, a natural yet inspired choice for walk-on music. Soon the guys themselves, Jay (drums), Ryan (bass), Sam (guitar), and finally frontman James, took to the stage and burst into the free-associative funk of â€˜Payday.â€™ Never have pothole rants been this groovy.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Live, the band conjures up a vibrant, energetic wall of noise that just cannot be captured on record. Yard Act are performers in the very best sense. Frontman James Smithâ€™s stage presence is unrivalled, the sincerity and wit that pervades these songs was only added to by the on-stage interludial banter. The audience connection only got stronger when the self-proclaimed â€œBen from Bradfordâ€ was invited at random onto the stage to recite the lyrics for â€˜Peanutsâ€™. His recital was flawless and impressiveÂ  - especially given the passageâ€™s lyrical density. This is a testament to the passion of Yard Actâ€™s fan base, as is the sold-out nature of this gig. All the tickets had been shifted months ago so we felt beyond privileged to be there witnessing musical history.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;What became so apparent across the setlist was the sheer range and talent of each member. From the throbbing, almost rave-like bass tones on â€˜Pour Anotherâ€™ to perfectly mixed drum grooves, theyâ€™re clearly masters of their craft. The grandeur of the instrumental cacophony elevates these astute everyday lyrical observations to hypervivid proportions. From confronting the realities of a post-Brexit Britain to exposing the latent xenophobia of our left-behind communities, Smith acutely taps into the political currents of our age through wit, satire and character study. This last component is most apparent on â€˜Tall Poppiesâ€™, an emotional height towards the end of the gig. The song chronicles the rise and demise of a village-school jock from Greater Manchester, seeming to gain the status of hometown hero (even as he never pokes his head out of the small pond that was always his world). â€œWe are sorry, truly we are sorry, we are just trying to get by tooâ€ is the final elegiac paean to his erstwhile friend, whose life was cut short by cancer; Smith draws on the universalised struggle of just existing.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;This highlighting of the common struggle of ordinary people was the moment at which this Yard Act show became truly transcendent. The sombre guitar licks at the songâ€™s end seemed to drown out the circling thoughts in our minds as the crowd fell into a moment of solidarity, Radio 6 dads and arty students alike. Suddenly, we both felt that our freezing cold trek to Leeds was worth every shiver. In a final surprise for the Brudenell audience, a rendition of LCD Soundsystemâ€™s â€˜Daft Punk Is Playing at My Houseâ€™ livened up the room. Unsurprisingly, Baba Ali joined the headliners for this cover, trusty synth tones in tow.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;In the months that followed the gig, Yard Act received plaudits from the likes of Dave Grohl and Elton John (who even covered their emotive album-closure, â€˜100% Enduranceâ€™). There is no certainly no stopping these West Yorkshire musicians, now with a Mercury Prize nomination under their belts. It certainly felt special to see these rising stars up-close, at an intimate venue, the size of which feels infinitesimal compared to their future haunts.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Only a privileged few get to see any great band in their prime.

Hot off their release of their much-lauded debut album *The Overload*, the Leeds post-punk four-piece delivered a set that would please anyone: from the singerâ€™s bigoted alter-ego Graeme to the mullet-sporting upstarts that he so despises. Both demographics were out in force as we brushed shoulders with IPA-drinking Radio 6 dads to find a spot in the packed, sweaty crowd.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSupport act (and labelmates) Baba Ali prepared the stage with infectious, analogue synth anthems, almost reminiscent of a â€˜Being Boiledâ€™-era Human League. The titular frontman brought a charismatic presence, grooving with his mic stand over the bodied, primal tones of a silent boiler-suited keyboardist. Comparisons to LCD Soundsystem abounded. We highly recommend you check out their latest album *Memory Device*, to get a taste for yourself. As Yard Actâ€™s arrival approached, the crowd seemed to be steadily flooded with more and more Graeme-types. Anticipation peaked with opening tones of Fatboy Slimâ€™s â€˜Right Here, Right Nowâ€™, a natural yet inspired choice for walk-on music. Soon the guys themselves, Jay (drums), Ryan (bass), Sam (guitar), and finally frontman James, took to the stage and burst into the free-associative funk of â€˜Payday.â€™ Never have pothole rants been this groovy.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLive, the band conjures up a vibrant, energetic wall of noise that just cannot be captured on record. Yard Act are performers in the very best sense. Frontman James Smithâ€™s stage presence is unrivalled, the sincerity and wit that pervades these songs was only added to by the on-stage interludial banter. The audience connection only got stronger when the self-proclaimed â€œBen from Bradfordâ€ was invited at random onto the stage to recite the lyrics for â€˜Peanutsâ€™. His recital was flawless and impressiveÂ  - especially given the passageâ€™s lyrical density. This is a testament to the passion of Yard Actâ€™s fan base, as is the sold-out nature of this gig. All the tickets had been shifted months ago so we felt beyond privileged to be there witnessing musical history.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWhat became so apparent across the setlist was the sheer range and talent of each member. From the throbbing, almost rave-like bass tones on â€˜Pour Anotherâ€™ to perfectly mixed drum grooves, theyâ€™re clearly masters of their craft. The grandeur of the instrumental cacophony elevates these astute everyday lyrical observations to hypervivid proportions. From confronting the realities of a post-Brexit Britain to exposing the latent xenophobia of our left-behind communities, Smith acutely taps into the political currents of our age through wit, satire and character study. This last component is most apparent on â€˜Tall Poppiesâ€™, an emotional height towards the end of the gig. The song chronicles the rise and demise of a village-school jock from Greater Manchester, seeming to gain the status of hometown hero (even as he never pokes his head out of the small pond that was always his world). â€œWe are sorry, truly we are sorry, we are just trying to get by tooâ€ is the final elegiac paean to his erstwhile friend, whose life was cut short by cancer; Smith draws on the universalised struggle of just existing.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis highlighting of the common struggle of ordinary people was the moment at which this Yard Act show became truly transcendent. The sombre guitar licks at the songâ€™s end seemed to drown out the circling thoughts in our minds as the crowd fell into a moment of solidarity, Radio 6 dads and arty students alike. Suddenly, we both felt that our freezing cold trek to Leeds was worth every shiver. In a final surprise for the Brudenell audience, a rendition of LCD Soundsystemâ€™s â€˜Daft Punk Is Playing at My Houseâ€™ livened up the room. Unsurprisingly, Baba Ali joined the headliners for this cover, trusty synth tones in tow.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIn the months that followed the gig, Yard Act received plaudits from the likes of Dave Grohl and Elton John (who even covered their emotive album-closure, â€˜100% Enduranceâ€™). There is no certainly no stopping these West Yorkshire musicians, now with a Mercury Prize nomination under their belts. It certainly felt special to see these rising stars up-close, at an intimate venue, the size of which feels infinitesimal compared to their future haunts.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_infoBox\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_thumbnailCredit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Paul Hudson\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_changelog\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_googleAppsUsernameYork\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;as3998\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_googleAppsUsernameNouse\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;alfie.sansom\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_name1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Alfie\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_name2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Sansom\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_userid\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,148532],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_created\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;2022-10-12T17:57:51.000Z\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_notes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_thumbnail\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_changepass\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_deleted\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_suspended\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_facebook\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_twitter\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_instagram\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_linkedin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_snapchat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_bio\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_archive_username\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_archive_email\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articles_featured\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_pronouns\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;he/him\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;]}]}]]\\\\\\\&quot;]}],[0,{\\\\\\\&quot;articles_id\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,151114],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_categories\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;4,24,1870\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_authors\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;148350\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_published\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\&quot;2023-01-11T17:00:00.000Z\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;editions_id\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_editionPage\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_updated\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\&quot;2023-01-11T14:47:25.000Z\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInLists\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInSearch\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInAdmin\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_type\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_slug\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;review-the-pretty-reckless--other-worlds-lp\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_extraMetadata\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_thumbnail\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;6610\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_lifetimeViews\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,197],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_archiveFallback\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_socialConfig\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;1,1,1,1\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_mediaCharterDone\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_socialExcerpt\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_dropCapital\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_displayImages\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_isThumbnailPortrait\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts\\\\\\\&quot;:[1,\\\\\\\&quot;[[0,{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,814490],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articles_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,151114],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_timestamp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;2023-01-11T14:47:25.000Z\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_userid\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,148532],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_headline\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Review: The Pretty Reckless â€“ Other Worlds LP\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_excerpt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Camila Hernandez praises the prog rockers&#39;

Momsen&#39;s vocals are forceful and explosive, evoking the spirit of Chris Cornell himself. This is developed further in â€˜The Keeperâ€™, where American multi-instrumentalist Alain Johannes plays a gracious melody that is complemented by Momsen&#39;s hazy voice that transcends into a poetic take on the original track. Momsen is joined by former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron in a brand-new version of â€˜Halfway Thereâ€™.

of fun-house, saturated, passionate encounters with the queer complexity of the self; of a plastic theatre delicately draped over the eyes, for the perceiver to unpick, and the reader to observe. &lt;em&gt;Women On The Verge&lt;/em&gt; sings of the hyperreal fiction of macabre, of the melodrama of the countercultural Movida MadrileÃ±a. The director clothes the screen with colour, confusion, contradiction, and all the edges of beauty until we are left with a giddy cinematic collage of film noir and high camp. With this tragicomedy, AlmodÃ³var announces that he has no intention of being held captive by the kinds of archetypally urban characters that had brought him success before &lt;em&gt;Women On The Verge&lt;/em&gt; locked itself into the canon of queer Spanish cinema. This time, the director infuses his vision with a full-bodied escapism found in the distinctly American screwball comedy genre; one that is governed by a frenetic rhythm of battling impulses, of worlds that are saturated with the hues of theatricality.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;From the model to the plastic view of the Madrid skyline visible from Pepaâ€™s (Carmen Maura) terrace, everything is designed to make you aware that this is only cinema, only fantasy. The controlling metaphor is right there at the start. AlmodÃ³var pans over a fanciful array of plants, chickens, ducks and rabbits which occupy the space of Pepaâ€™s terrace, while her offscreen voice allegorises what we see into a Biblical narrative of Noah trying to rescue pairs of all the animals. After all, it seems that all the retained, wild, and uncensored vitality left in the climate of those who had not been â€˜rescuedâ€™ from AlmodÃ³varâ€™s cinematic impulse of the Valley of the Fallen, of complete yet celebrated disobedience.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the conflicted entanglement between the centrepiece couple Pepa and IvÃ¡n (Fernando GuillÃ©n) and their relentless series of missed phone calls and loose-end affair cover-ups, AlmodÃ³var is a keen observer of the colours which make us human. Whether it be sporadic veils of red or sombre shadows of blue, the characters seem to become emotionally acclimated to this code of interior design and the mercurial individuals who inhabit this kaleidoscopic space. The palette threatens to cross over into the garish without ever succumbing to the temptation. The exaggerated aestheticism the Spanish director nurtures falls in line with the stylised culture and genre of camp. One of the most prominent studies of the camp genre derives from Susan Sontagâ€™s &lt;em&gt;Notes&lt;/em&gt; (1964), where she describes it as â€œ...one way of seeing the world as an aesthetic phenomenon. That way, the way of Camp, is not in terms of beauty, but in terms of the degree of artifice, of stylisation.â€ Even the introductory slideshow compartmentalises the female figure through a series of magazine scraps. Lipstick, nails, heels, legs, eyes and lips are strung around stationary butterflies and potent bouquets; all positioned to appeal, to sell fantasy through their posturing and encompassing a parody of 1960s American movie openings. Almost as if Youngâ€™s &lt;em&gt;From Russia, With Loveâ€™s&lt;/em&gt; title sequence was made less voyeuristic and more pulp, yet still as pleasurable. However, the debris of authenticity lies in the sentimental surface at the charactersâ€™ rainbow-coloured cores.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of announcing its filmic transparency, &lt;em&gt;Women on the Verge&lt;/em&gt; is obtrusive in the most delightful manner, diverging from the sensibility of a more distanced stance. Yet, a blocking element inherent in the directorâ€™s vision seems to obstruct us from teetering on a kind of superfluidity, of being overly full, or much too ripe, on the cusp of spoiling.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;It is the â€œartificeâ€ that Sontag highlights as the determining lushness of camp. In AlmodÃ³varâ€™s screen, it is the unblinking house plants taking on a silicone quality; the cameraâ€™s positioning within the mechanics of a telephone; the taunting symmetry of interior design as a space for hysteria; and, lastly, the kitschean and gastronomical substitute for blood, &lt;em&gt;gazpacho&lt;/em&gt;, which deter us from realism. â€œIâ€™m sick of being good,â€ AlmodÃ³var appears to speak to us through Pepaâ€™s character as she violently blends an uncountable number of tomatoes for her barbiturate-laced soup, telling us that he is distressed with convention, and wants to â€œ...get to a stage of greater freedom,â€ as he remarks in &lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://www.draliceevans.com/post/iberia-s-backlash-against-religious-authoritarianism-and-rise-of-gender-equality#:~:text=%22The%20moral%20of%20all%20my,towards%20gender%20and%20sexual%20liberation.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, both of these culinary and artistic visions are to die for.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;In two grand and summative statements, Sontag writes: â€œThe whole point of Camp is to dethrone the serious. Camp is playful, anti-serious. More precisely, Camp involves a new, more complex relation to â€œthe serious.â€ One can be serious about the frivolous, frivolous about the serious.â€ And in &lt;em&gt;Women on the Verge&lt;/em&gt;, it seems, AlmodÃ³var performs a carnival-coloured charade of his own interpretation of feminine behaviour through a somewhat queered lens. This Hitchcock-infused, sublime escapism often aches to claw at the screenâ€™s blackened confines, hardened to plastic, drowned in sentimentality, then solidified again, and we all meet him in the end for one last beautiful exhale. This is AlmodÃ³var at his most powerfully delicate.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;AlmodÃ³var is a director of beautifully-poised excess; of fun-house, saturated, passionate encounters with the queer complexity of the self; of a plastic theatre delicately draped over the eyes, for the perceiver to unpick, and the reader to observe. *Women On The Verge* sings of the hyperreal fiction of macabre, of the melodrama of the countercultural Movida MadrileÃ±a.

With this tragicomedy, AlmodÃ³var announces that he has no intention of being held captive by the kinds of archetypally urban characters that had brought him success before *Women On The Verge* locked itself into the canon of queer Spanish cinema. This time, the director infuses his vision with a full-bodied escapism found in the distinctly American screwball comedy genre; one that is governed by a frenetic rhythm of battling impulses, of worlds that are saturated with the hues of theatricality.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFrom the model to the plastic view of the Madrid skyline visible from Pepaâ€™s (Carmen Maura) terrace, everything is designed to make you aware that this is only cinema, only fantasy. The controlling metaphor is right there at the start. AlmodÃ³var pans over a fanciful array of plants, chickens, ducks and rabbits which occupy the space of Pepaâ€™s terrace, while her offscreen voice allegorises what we see into a Biblical narrative of Noah trying to rescue pairs of all the animals. After all, it seems that all the retained, wild, and uncensored vitality left in the climate of those who had not been â€˜rescuedâ€™ from AlmodÃ³varâ€™s cinematic impulse of the Valley of the Fallen, of complete yet celebrated disobedience.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDespite the conflicted entanglement between the centrepiece couple Pepa and IvÃ¡n (Fernando GuillÃ©n) and their relentless series of missed phone calls and loose-end affair cover-ups, AlmodÃ³var is a keen observer of the colours which make us human. Whether it be sporadic veils of red or sombre shadows of blue, the characters seem to become emotionally acclimated to this code of interior design and the mercurial individuals who inhabit this kaleidoscopic space. The palette threatens to cross over into the garish without ever succumbing to the temptation. The exaggerated aestheticism the Spanish director nurtures falls in line with the stylised culture and genre of camp. One of the most prominent studies of the camp genre derives from Susan Sontagâ€™s *Notes* (1964), where she describes it as â€œ...one way of seeing the world as an aesthetic phenomenon. That way, the way of Camp, is not in terms of beauty, but in terms of the degree of artifice, of stylisation.â€ Even the introductory slideshow compartmentalises the female figure through a series of magazine scraps. Lipstick, nails, heels, legs, eyes and lips are strung around stationary butterflies and potent bouquets; all positioned to appeal, to sell fantasy through their posturing and encompassing a parody of 1960s American movie openings. Almost as if Youngâ€™s *From Russia, With Loveâ€™s* title sequence was made less voyeuristic and more pulp, yet still as pleasurable. However, the debris of authenticity lies in the sentimental surface at the charactersâ€™ rainbow-coloured cores.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nInstead of announcing its filmic transparency, *Women on the Verge* is obtrusive in the most delightful manner, diverging from the sensibility of a more distanced stance. Yet, a blocking element inherent in the directorâ€™s vision seems to obstruct us from teetering on a kind of superfluidity, of being overly full, or much too ripe, on the cusp of spoiling.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIt is the â€œartificeâ€ that Sontag highlights as the determining lushness of camp. In AlmodÃ³varâ€™s screen, it is the unblinking house plants taking on a silicone quality; the cameraâ€™s positioning within the mechanics of a telephone; the taunting symmetry of interior design as a space for hysteria; and, lastly, the kitschean and gastronomical substitute for blood, *gazpacho*, which deter us from realism. â€œIâ€™m sick of being good,â€ AlmodÃ³var appears to speak to us through Pepaâ€™s character as she violently blends an uncountable number of tomatoes for her barbiturate-laced soup, telling us that he is distressed with convention, and wants to â€œ...get to a stage of greater freedom,â€ as he remarks in [an interview](https://www.draliceevans.com/post/iberia-s-backlash-against-religious-authoritarianism-and-rise-of-gender-equality#:~:text=%22The%20moral%20of%20all%20my,towards%20gender%20and%20sexual%20liberation.). Ultimately, both of these culinary and artistic visions are to die for.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIn two grand and summative statements, Sontag writes: â€œThe whole point of Camp is to dethrone the serious. Camp is playful, anti-serious. More precisely, Camp involves a new, more complex relation to â€œthe serious.â€ One can be serious about the frivolous, frivolous about the serious.â€ And in *Women on the Verge*, it seems, AlmodÃ³var performs a carnival-coloured charade of his own interpretation of feminine behaviour through a somewhat queered lens. This Hitchcock-infused, sublime escapism often aches to claw at the screenâ€™s blackened confines, hardened to plastic, drowned in sentimentality, then solidified again, and we all meet him in the end for one last beautiful exhale. This is AlmodÃ³var at his most powerfully delicate.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_infoBox\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_thumbnailCredit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;El Deseo\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_changelog\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_googleAppsUsernameYork\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;krb533\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_googleAppsUsernameNouse\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;kyle.boulton\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_name1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Kyle\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_name2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Boulton\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_userid\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,148302],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_created\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;2020-10-18T15:57:43.000Z\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_notes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_thumbnail\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;5741\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_changepass\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_deleted\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_suspended\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_facebook\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_twitter\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_instagram\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_linkedin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_snapchat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_bio\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_archive_username\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_archive_email\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articles_featured\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;150003\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_pronouns\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null]}]}]]\\\\\\\&quot;]}],[0,{\\\\\\\&quot;articles_id\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,150669],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_categories\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;4,76,2483\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_authors\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;148403\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_published\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\&quot;2022-03-24T13:20:28.000Z\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;editions_id\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_editionPage\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_updated\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\&quot;2022-03-24T13:40:53.000Z\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInLists\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInSearch\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInAdmin\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_type\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_slug\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;revival-or-just-plain-reboot\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_extraMetadata\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_thumbnail\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;5916\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_lifetimeViews\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,138],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_archiveFallback\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_socialConfig\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;1,1,1,1\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_mediaCharterDone\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_socialExcerpt\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_dropCapital\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_displayImages\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_isThumbnailPortrait\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts\\\\\\\&quot;:[1,\\\\\\\&quot;[[0,{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,812649],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articles_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,150669],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_timestamp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;2022-03-24T13:40:53.000Z\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_userid\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,148388],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_headline\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Revival or Just Plain Reboot?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_excerpt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;And Just Like That...

The current contender is Matt Reeves, probably most well-known for the final two films in the &lt;em&gt;Planet of the Apes&lt;/em&gt; reboot. Reeves faced a hard task in creating another successful version of &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt;. How does one keep this iteration unique when itâ€™s now the sixth weâ€™ve seen on screen, the third in the last ten years? Especially when one of those iterations â€“ Christopher Nolanâ€™s &lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;/em&gt; trilogy â€“ managed to surpass the confines of the superhero film and is considered one of the best film trilogies of all time.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The weight of this task must have fed into the stylisation of &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt; because if there is one word that feels apt for the film it is â€˜weightâ€™. Nolanâ€™s films were realistic but unafraid to go for the cinematically spectacular. In contrast, &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt; is very much a gritty and grimy boots on the ground affair. This is this iterationâ€™s main unique selling point. If someone was to really dress up as a bat and attempt to beat up criminals, this is how it would feel. Where Nolan still had the mythic hero quality, Reeves depicts a Batman who is still very much a human. From the clink of his boots to every punch decked into a thugâ€™s skull, Reeves places us amid the action. This grit is transferred to the city of Gotham as well. We seldom see Gotham in daylight. Each shot looks like itâ€™s sagging to breaking point with rain, corruption, and dread. Whilst this ultra-dour tone is a bit heavy handed at timesâ€“ I couldnâ€™t help but laugh when Nirvana started playing or when we heard Pattinsonâ€™s voiceover for the first time â€“ for the most part it succeeds. Reeves emphatically puts the goth in Gotham.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;With the objective to put the goth in Gotham, it makes sense that Reeves called on Robert Pattinson to lead the cast as the cityâ€™s masked vigilante. Pattinson has already cut his chops playing sullen characters in the famous teenage vampire franchise, &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt;. However, such a remark doesnâ€™t really represent Pattinson as an actor anymore. Ever since &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt;, heâ€™s stayed faraway from big franchises, in favour of honing his acting craft with interesting indie directors.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;That might be why some critics are disappointed to see Pattinsonâ€™s performance as Batman and Bruce as one note, in contrast to Christian Baleâ€™s portrayal in &lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;/em&gt; trilogy where he got to express his talent playing almost three different personas within one. The mythic Batman, the billionaire playboy faÃ§ade, and the fractured Bruce behind the closed doors of Wayne Manor. In Pattinsonâ€™s version, just like we barely see Gotham in daylight, we also barely see Bruce Wayne without the cowl.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The glimmers we do see arenâ€™t exactly full of life either. In fact, Pattinsonâ€™s Wayne and Batman are largely indistinguishable. Pattinsonâ€™s Bruce Wayne is a depressive insomniac who only begins to function when beating up Gothamâ€™s criminal underbelly. Where critics label this as one noted though I rather believe it is evidence of a compelling character and signifies what comes to be his arc across the film.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Near the beginning of the film, we see Bruce Wayne journaling the details of his recent escapades, in order to not forget them. For the broken protagonist, they all blur into one. This is because he isnâ€™t Batman with a purpose yet. Bruce goes out every night not to be a hero, but because he knows no other way to handle his trauma. He is resigned to a cycle of violence upon violence. The arc we begin to see is Bruce beginning to realise that his Batman could be something more than a vehicle rapidly careening towards fulfilling his own death wish. As we see Batman stand in the clear view of daylight at the end of the film, he realises Batman could actually be a hero to aspire to.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;With Riddler having exposed the well of corruption seeded into Gothamâ€™s every institution through fetish for duct tape, perhaps Bruce realises that he can also be a hero outside of the mask. Affecting just as much change as a key public figure with the resources for philanthropy. The Batman isnâ€™t an origin story of the vigilante; Batman has been active for two years in the filmâ€™s timeline. However, it is the beginning of Batman actually being a hero that inspires and a Bruce Wayne that can offer his support to the city instead of being a social recluse.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;With the next villain from &lt;em&gt;Batmanâ€™s&lt;/em&gt; rogueâ€™s gallery already teased for the future, Reeves is pencilled in to lead a trilogy of films. Itâ€™s too early to say whether this will eventually succeed &lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;/em&gt; trilogy as being the best Batman on screen.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;There is something in the way of Batmanâ€™s iconography that keeps bringing new directors to the caped crusader and finding new ways to bring him to life on the big screen. The current contender is Matt Reeves, probably most well-known for the final two films in the *Planet of the Apes* reboot. Reeves faced a hard task in creating another successful version of *Batman*. How does one keep this iteration unique when itâ€™s now the sixth weâ€™ve seen on screen, the third in the last ten years? Especially when one of those iterations â€“ Christopher Nolanâ€™s *The Dark Knight* trilogy â€“ managed to surpass the confines of the superhero film and is considered one of the best film trilogies of all time.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe weight of this task must have fed into the stylisation of *The Batman* because if there is one word that feels apt for the film it is â€˜weightâ€™. Nolanâ€™s films were realistic but unafraid to go for the cinematically spectacular. In contrast, *The Batman* is very much a gritty and grimy boots on the ground affair. This is this iterationâ€™s main unique selling point. If someone was to really dress up as a bat and attempt to beat up criminals, this is how it would feel. Where Nolan still had the mythic hero quality, Reeves depicts a Batman who is still very much a human. From the clink of his boots to every punch decked into a thugâ€™s skull, Reeves places us amid the action. This grit is transferred to the city of Gotham as well. We seldom see Gotham in daylight. Each shot looks like itâ€™s sagging to breaking point with rain, corruption, and dread. Whilst this ultra-dour tone is a bit heavy handed at timesâ€“ I couldnâ€™t help but laugh when Nirvana started playing or when we heard Pattinsonâ€™s voiceover for the first time â€“ for the most part it succeeds. Reeves emphatically puts the goth in Gotham.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWith the objective to put the goth in Gotham, it makes sense that Reeves called on Robert Pattinson to lead the cast as the cityâ€™s masked vigilante. Pattinson has already cut his chops playing sullen characters in the famous teenage vampire franchise, *Twilight*. However, such a remark doesnâ€™t really represent Pattinson as an actor anymore. Ever since *Twilight*, heâ€™s stayed faraway from big franchises, in favour of honing his acting craft with interesting indie directors.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThat might be why some critics are disappointed to see Pattinsonâ€™s performance as Batman and Bruce as one note, in contrast to Christian Baleâ€™s portrayal in *The Dark Knight* trilogy where he got to express his talent playing almost three different personas within one. The mythic Batman, the billionaire playboy faÃ§ade, and the fractured Bruce behind the closed doors of Wayne Manor. In Pattinsonâ€™s version, just like we barely see Gotham in daylight, we also barely see Bruce Wayne without the cowl.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe glimmers we do see arenâ€™t exactly full of life either. In fact, Pattinsonâ€™s Wayne and Batman are largely indistinguishable. Pattinsonâ€™s Bruce Wayne is a depressive insomniac who only begins to function when beating up Gothamâ€™s criminal underbelly. Where critics label this as one noted though I rather believe it is evidence of a compelling character and signifies what comes to be his arc across the film.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNear the beginning of the film, we see Bruce Wayne journaling the details of his recent escapades, in order to not forget them. For the broken protagonist, they all blur into one. This is because he isnâ€™t Batman with a purpose yet. Bruce goes out every night not to be a hero, but because he knows no other way to handle his trauma. He is resigned to a cycle of violence upon violence. The arc we begin to see is Bruce beginning to realise that his Batman could be something more than a vehicle rapidly careening towards fulfilling his own death wish. As we see Batman stand in the clear view of daylight at the end of the film, he realises Batman could actually be a hero to aspire to.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWith Riddler having exposed the well of corruption seeded into Gothamâ€™s every institution through fetish for duct tape, perhaps Bruce realises that he can also be a hero outside of the mask. Affecting just as much change as a key public figure with the resources for philanthropy. The Batman isnâ€™t an origin story of the vigilante; Batman has been active for two years in the filmâ€™s timeline. However, it is the beginning of Batman actually being a hero that inspires and a Bruce Wayne that can offer his support to the city instead of being a social recluse.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWith the next villain from *Batmanâ€™s* rogueâ€™s gallery already teased for the future, Reeves is pencilled in to lead a trilogy of films. Itâ€™s too early to say whether this will eventually succeed *The Dark Knight* trilogy as being the best Batman on screen.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_infoBox\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_thumbnailCredit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Warner Bros.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_changelog\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_googleAppsUsernameYork\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;krb533\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_googleAppsUsernameNouse\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;kyle.boulton\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_name1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Kyle\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_name2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Boulton\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_userid\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,148302],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_created\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;2020-10-18T15:57:43.000Z\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_notes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_thumbnail\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;5741\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_changepass\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_deleted\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_suspended\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_facebook\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_twitter\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_instagram\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_linkedin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_snapchat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_bio\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_archive_username\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_archive_email\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articles_featured\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;150003\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_pronouns\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null]}]}]]\\\\\\\&quot;]}],[0,{\\\\\\\&quot;articles_id\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,150720],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_categories\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;4,76,1866\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_authors\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;148329\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_published\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\&quot;2022-04-22T09:40:31.000Z\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;editions_id\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_editionPage\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_updated\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\&quot;2022-04-28T13:28:20.000Z\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInLists\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInSearch\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInAdmin\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_type\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_slug\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;review-the-northman\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_extraMetadata\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_thumbnail\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;5969\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_lifetimeViews\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,199],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_archiveFallback\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_socialConfig\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;1,1,1,1\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_mediaCharterDone\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_socialExcerpt\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_dropCapital\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_displayImages\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_isThumbnailPortrait\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts\\\\\\\&quot;:[1,\\\\\\\&quot;[[0,{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,812871],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articles_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,150720],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_timestamp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;2022-04-28T13:28:20.000Z\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_userid\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,148302],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_headline\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Review: The Northman\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_excerpt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Sophia Ash excavates the bloody core of Robert Eggers&#39; unrelenting blockbuster\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_text\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&lt;p&gt;A tale untangling against the bitter cold plains of 10th century Scandinavia, &lt;em&gt;The Northman&lt;/em&gt; throws us into the earthy yet surreal Viking world, entering a web of visions and prophecies overshadowed by gleeful brutality.

In anguish he watches, as his uncle brutally murders his father and with this all he has known as a child. When through sheer force of will he breaches his emotional paralysis, young Amleth flees to the seas, screaming a mantra to the skies; â€œI will avenge you father! I will save you mother! I will kill you FjÃ³lnir!â€ And thus is germinated the vow of vengeance that becomes his very essence, as he is forced to navigate the cold-hearted North to fulfill his promise. Here, in this bitter terrain, the slow, rhythmic pulsing of drumbeats catches on the air, harnessed into the violent cry of the wind as it spirals into storm. Amleth embarks, a lone warrior propelled only by his promise of vengeance, enveloped by the moan of battered bodies, the guttural yells of the bloodthirsty that skitter on the surface of that relentless beat.

And here, Eggers refuses to reign in the sheer violence of the Viking world; we see severed limbs contorted into the shapes of animals, entrails spilling from gaping wounds, crushed bones shattered with frightening ease.

Perhaps here the violence and gore is a little too excessive; it seems to become an indulgence, which is quick to lose its impact. It rings hollow, isolating the viewer. There is no attempt to tune any sense of morality Amleth may hold with our own; he is brutal, savage, unremitting. In this, our ability to connect with him, or even willingness to root for him, is hindered drastically. But perhaps this is the point. Our distance from the times is illuminated with unwavering force, there is no attempt to sugarcoat the unavoidably gory reality.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Though still, it seems that as the film unravels, this great Norse legend has been reduced to the tale of a man seeking vengeance, a tale steeped excessively in violence, with a smattering of romance in a subplot that feels predictable. Perhaps the danger is the inevitability that we will compare it to Shakespeareâ€™s tale, which against it dwindles down to an indulgence in empty aesthetics and crudely spun dialogue. Threads and twists are quickly lost in relentless spectacle and gore. Though Eggersâ€™ tale is an immense vision that thrusts us into the sheer brutality of the past, it is difficult to connect emotionally to characters that seem archetypal, lacking in depth and dimension.

So, widen your horizons and venture away from the navy-blue vintage â€˜ralphieâ€™ to get more for your money.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDonâ€™t bother with shoes- Itâ€™s really rare to find a decent pair of used shoes second-hand, let alone any that youâ€™d actually want, so save that for your online browsing.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOnline:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWhere to go: Depop, eBay, ASOS Marketplace, Beyond Retro, Rokit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHow to: Tailor your searches- Add â€˜vintageâ€™ to your search to bar if youâ€™re looking for higher quality, unique pieces.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDonâ€™t use the filters- this might seem counterintuitive but very few sellers categorize their products properly which means you might miss out on your new jacket.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nKeep Searching-It takes commitment but have a thorough scour if you want to find a true diamond in the rough as many sites have a lot of dull stock.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSearch for specific items- On a similar note, itâ€™s worth looking up the exact make, size and colour you want before searching on a selling platform as it will save you filtering through hundreds of â€˜not-quite-rightâ€™ Hilfiger Hoodies.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTake inspiration from others- Itâ€™s Depop specific but check out the â€˜likesâ€™ page of your friends and favourite influencers, itâ€™s a great way of discovering new sellers and getting inspiration.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_infoBox\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_thumbnailCredit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Dustin

about existing systemic racial injustice. A crucial step in the progression of this conversation is accountability; the Black Lives Matter movement has begun to place an expectation on the individual to not simply be passively non-racist, but to be actively anti-racist. The social media presence of fashion brands means that now more than ever, there is an increasingly close relationship between the consumer and the producer, allowing brands to be held to the same standard as public figures.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The alternative online boutique Dolls Kill found itself in controversy over comments made by co-founder Shoddy Lynn about the protests taking place in L.A. American comedian and rapper, Elijah Daniel, &lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://twitter.com/elijahdaniel/status/1267333703644012544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1267333703644012544&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.altpress.com%2Fnews%2Fdolls-kill-black-lives-matter-statement-protest%2F\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;shared Lynnâ€™s post&lt;/a&gt; and went viral. His tweet remarked on an Instagram post Lynn shared on her private account, depicting the Dolls Kill L.A. store with a line of armed police officers in front of it, captioned: â€œDirect Action in its gloryâ€. This sparked a flood of negative comments from many who perceived this as Lynn praising the police force for shooting the peaceful protesters outside her store. This post acted as a catalyst for many other influencers to speak out against the brand, starting the hashtag #dollskillboycott. The number of people denouncing the brand began to grow in the days following Danielâ€™s tweet made on June 1, ranging from prominent influencers to general customers.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Another brand who is facing accusations of racism is the trendy, sustainable clothing brand Reformation. Influencer Elle Santiago made a detailed &lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CBBw_ABjUCi/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;Instagram post&lt;/a&gt; in which she exposed the many times she experienced racial discrimination when working with the brand, such as them promoting her white colleagues over herself, who was the more qualified and experienced candidate.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Reformation is a prime example of what can be achieved through pressure from social media. In an Instagram post titled &lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CBJ1RFAnthN/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;â€˜Iâ€™ve Failedâ€™&lt;/a&gt;, Reformation founder Yael Aflalo made a statement in response to the allegations against her brand: â€œThe way we have practiced diversity in the past has been through a â€˜white gazeâ€™ that falls too close to ignoranceâ€¦ As a company, we have not leveraged our platform, our voice, and our content to combat the racism and injustice that pervades our countryâ€. Most significantly, however, is Yael Aflaloâ€™s decision to step down as CEO, as called for by Santiago in her Instagram post. Aflalo herself has also promised to &lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CBJ1RFAnthN/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;donate $500,000&lt;/a&gt; to three charities helping fight for black rights in the US. In addition, the brand will be launching a Diversity and Inclusion Board, and have vowed to put more emphasis on working with Black creators throughout the creative process.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The immense backlash received on social media has also been paramount in compelling Dolls Kill to take a stance on the Black Lives Matter movement and incite some form of change, both within the fashion community and the company itself. The brand released a statement entitled &lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://www.dollskill.com/what-we-stand-for\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;â€˜To Our Communityâ€™&lt;/a&gt; in which they intended to clarify the brandâ€™s position on the Black Lives Matter movement. They acknowledged that silence is compliance, and that there is a â€œneed to do more than be passively â€˜not racistâ€™â€. They acted on this statement through committing to buy â€œ$1 Million dollars worth of product from Black-owned fashion brands and designersâ€ as well as partnering with them â€œto donate 100% of the profits to charities and organizations of their choiceâ€. This is just one example of how social media can be utilised to amplify voices that often go unheard, becoming an effective tool in promoting change.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;There are many fashion and beauty companies however, who have used their platform and large following to support the Black Lives Matter movement and contribute to the many campaigns for change. One of which being the skincare and beauty company Glossier. The brand is &lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CA1K4rLpQq9/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;donating $1 Million&lt;/a&gt; to fight against â€œsystemic racism, white supremacy, and the historic oppression of the Black Communityâ€. $500,000 is going to charities and organisations who are spearheading the Black Lives Matter movement, and the other $500,000 is going to Black-owned beauty businesses. From personal experience, I have always identified Glossier as a brand that promotes diversity. When shopping online for foundation as a mixed-race girl, it was refreshing to see Glossier using models of different ethnicities to demonstrate their products, rather than white models with varying levels of tan. Diversity and inclusivity are ingrained in the ethos of the brand, making their contribution to the movement all the more valid, as they are not just jumping on the â€˜trendâ€™.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The same can be said for the infamous sportswear brand Adidas, who have always shown support for black athletes. Interestingly, Adidas released a statement on &lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://twitter.com/adidas/status/1270800426456227841\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; announcing the three-pronged approach through which they would be adapting their brand in relation to â€˜People, Communities, and Accountabilityâ€™. The sportswear brand will be investing $120 million towards Black communities in the United States over the next four years. Moreover, they have vowed to adopt a Zero Tolerance Policy in their effort to accept and improve their accountability.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Though, there is the ability to question: should fashion brands be required to comment on such movements? In their Instagram post captioned &lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CA6u5yrp_tp/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;â€˜We fucked upâ€™&lt;/a&gt;, Dolls Kill claimed that, as a fashion brand, they never felt it was their place to publicly comment. In considering this statement, it is true that as a large company, it is not possible to represent the ideals of everyone who works for you. There is also the danger of performative activism, in that brands feel pressured to respond, but do so without inciting any form of change. Once again, Dolls Kill can be used as an example. Before making any public statement regarding the Black Lives Matter movement, the brand posted three black squares on their Instagram for â€˜Blackout Tuesdayâ€™. They shared no links to petitions or educational resources, nor did they use their platform to share the perspectives of those who encounter racial discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, fashion brands should be expected to comment on movements such as Black Lives Matter, as industry plays a huge role in shaping the norm. We see fashion and beauty campaigns daily, and what we see inescapably influences what we consider to be â€˜normal; exposure to diversity would help to create a more accepting and tolerant society. They are huge corporations we are giving our money to, and although one individual cannot represent the views of an entire workforce, CEOs and those high up in the company indubitably impact the way the company functions as a whole. One ignorant leader, and the entire brand can lack diversity and awareness. This is why, even following their statement, Dolls Kill are still facing criticism. Though the companyâ€™s efforts to change and support the Black Lives Matter movement are invaluable and will undoubtedly encourage many of their customers to do the same, they never addressed the comments made by their co-founder Shoddy Lynn. Fashion brands are required to promote inclusivity and diversity, as at its core, fashion is a form of expression meant for all.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;As an individual, it can often feel as though you alone lack the ability to make a significant impact. However, as we have seen in the US, seemingly simple actions such as signing petitions and making small donations do indeed provoke remarkable change. Another simple way to support the movement, especially as a student, is to purchase from Black-owned fashion and beauty brands.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some to take a look at:&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://www.nubianskin.com/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;Nubian Skin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://www.fentybeauty.com/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;Fenty Beauty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://www.daughterofabohemian.com/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;Daughter of Bohemian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://sincerelynude.com/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;Sincerely Nude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://www.setathelabel.com/new-collection\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;Seta the Label&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://alerojasmine.com/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;AleroJasmine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://www.grass-fields.com/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;Grass Fields&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://lihabeauty.com/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;Liha BeautyÂ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://anitagrant.com/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;Anita GrantÂ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://www.ofuure.com/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;Ofuure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;The murder of George Floyd has sparked a vital and widespread conversation about existing systemic racial injustice.

The fashion industry as we know it to be has spent decades thriving off of inspiration from other countries and cultures, from textiles, designs and even production; so much so that the lines between inspiration and appropriation have eventually become blurred. Western societies are also notorious for cultural appropriation; for taking aspects from another culture and branding them as their own discoveries and achievements. And when these two mentalities meet, the origins of the latest fashion trends can become misrepresented.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Every day we find ourselves in an increasingly globalised world, and so it is natural and understandable that fashion has also taken this course, branching out and finding inspiration in other cultures; it keeps it new, exciting and unpredictable. Itâ€™s what I love about it. However, sometimes designers and the industry take it a step too far, treading into territory that has deep cultural significance. And once they channel these designs and motifs into their own collections, Western buyers are often naively unaware of the gravitas of their clothing choices.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;As well as this, the industry actively exploits many cultural fashions for their own profit, while at the same time failing to diversify their companies in any other way. For me, this is when inspiration and appreciation become appropriation. You cannot pick and choose which parts of a culture you want, simply for your own benefit. You cannot continue to base your collections on other cultures, while still employing a predominately white workforce. You cannot keep discriminating against people of colour while continuing to take from their culture. It contributes to a power imbalance that western societies have spent centuries forcing on the rest of the world; whilst they profit, other countries remain suppressed and exploited. This oppression is consistent throughout the whole production; not only seen in their marketing, but also in their manufacturing processes which commonly outsource to â€˜developingâ€™ countries, with many production processes arguably engaging in a form of â€˜modern day slaveryâ€™; but this is another discussion.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Cultural appropriation comes in many forms, but one strong example is when fashion houses disregard the cultural significance of a garment, instead choosing to turn it into the next fleeting trend. East-Asian countries like China and Japan often unwillingly find themselves victims of this. Oriental patterns and motifs have been fashion targets for decades, across both high-end and high-street fashion, and, in my opinion, are becoming more and more disrespectful every season. Western fashion has captured oriental garments, like the kimono and the qipao, and diminished them into a night-out outfit. Many adapted designs have been criticised for sexualising and fetishizing oriental garments by making them short, tight and revealing, subsequently feeding into a wider discourse that East-Asian women have been victim to from western society. This was particularly perpetuated in a clothing collaboration between Little Mix and Pretty Little Thing which showcased many garments clearly suited to nights out and clubbing â€˜inspiredâ€™ by the traditional Chinese qipao dress, a strong symbol of female emancipation within the culture. This disrespect is also reinforced through Halloween costumes, as every year we dread the influx of â€˜Native Americansâ€™, â€˜Japanese samuraisâ€™ (also ignorantly branded as â€˜ninjasâ€™), â€˜Bollywood dancersâ€™ and â€˜Geishasâ€™, all usually with the prefix â€˜sexyâ€™ put before them.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, brands habitually exploit cultural properties for aesthetic purposes, while failing to acknowledge that the owners of these features have been historically or even currently discriminated against for displaying them. Usually this discrimination is committed by western or European societies, which are now the ones profiting from the culturally appropriative garments. For example, in Marc Jacobâ€™s 2016 SS show, he accessorised his predominately white modelled collection with dreadlocks, a hairstyle that has its roots in black cultures. In contrast, in wider society, black wearers of dreadlocks are frequently discriminated against for their supposedly â€œunprofessionalâ€ appearance, as widely seen in workplaces and schools. While it is used as an aesthetic for one group of people, it is a harsh and unfair reality for another; it furthers the cultural power imbalance as white wearers can utilise and dispose of it as they wish without any repercussions, whilst it has a much deeper significance for black wearers of the hairstyle, such as Rastafarians. This insensitivity was also perpetuated amongst Gucci who, in 2019, shamelessly lined their pockets by selling turbans, a meaningful religious symbol for Sikhs who have historically faced extreme discrimination, as part of their AW collection.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Cultural appropriation in fashion is not new by any means, but we are becoming more hyper-aware of it, with recent world events shedding light on the pivotal role the fashion industry plays in racism and racial discrimination. As an industry, it is responsible for shaping and influencing many of our normalised societal ideals, most of which centre around the white woman; it is one of the biggest and most influential industries within the western world. But now is itsâ€™ time to actively change itsâ€™ responsibilities; a time to express gratitude to the cultures that they are inspired by, to display racial diversity amongst their models and workers, to show respect to the garments that they are reconstructing; to simply stop using culturally significant garments as fleeting trends.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;If fashion really does reflect society, then what does this say about culture weâ€™ve created?

The owner, Danielle, prides her brand on its transparency and is incredibly engaged on social media with her customers, constantly show-ing us behind the scenes of Hissy Fit. Watching her TikToks and Instagram stories give us an in-sight into the entire process of the production of our purchase â€” from buying the fabrics to packing the orders. In addition, something we often donâ€™t see from small brands, usually simply due to supply and demand, is an inclusive size range. However, Danielle always ensures that her collections are available in sizes XSâ€“3XL, leaving no customer behind. And if all of these amazing values werenâ€™t enough, sustainability is always at the heart of every Hissy Fit piece of clothing, whilst still managing to keep prices affordable; all manufacturing takes place in Birmingham at a local family-run factory and all pieces are made with dead stock fabric! Their Instagram is @his-syfitclothing.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;If youâ€™re looking for a dress that does all the talking for you, look no further than Farai London. Originating in, you guessed it, London, Farai London has made a name for itself through its unique and striking prints which aim to make the customer feel, as they put it, â€œspecial, sexy and spectacular.â€ Quality is at the centre of all of their designs; branding themselves as a luxury company, a Farai London order may admittedly be reserved for those more special occasions. Whilst the black-owned label is very much on the rise as a smaller business, now being stocked in Selfridges and Revolve, youâ€™re still likely to be the only one in the room in a Farai piece, constantly replyingâ€œthanks, itâ€™s Farai London.â€ On Instagram, they are @farailondon.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Originally TikTok-famed for its bestselling Kernel jumpsuit, Peachy Den creates unique yet comfortable and wearable pieces to take you from day to night. Whilst on the pricier side,Peachy Den pieces are guaranteed to last you throughout the seasons - between velvet jump-suits and wide leg trousers, thereâ€™s something for every occasion â€” dress them up with heels, or pair with trainers for a day in town. Notably, the stand out service offered by PeachyDen is their free alterations- customers are free to post their item back for their desired alterations (although currently on hold, according to their website)â€” perfect for us on the shorter side!

Customers can choose from a range of funky, festival inspired designs or have the creative freedom to order a custom made design. Their made to order service ensures no garment wasted, although this does mean wait time is a little longer than the next day delivery weâ€™ve gotten used to, so make sure to order in time for your event, especially during festival season.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;No outfit is complete without the perfect accessory â€” a trusty handbag to hold all your secrets. Born out of lockdown, Amy singlehandedly runs her small business of &#39;90s-style shoulder bags, hand making every bag individually in her home studio in Cardiff. Similar to Hissy Fit, GOSH girl (standing for groovy, original, sustainable and handmade) resourcefully uses vintage and remnant fabrics, meaning many of their collections are limited and unique. Amy also of-fers a made-to-order service, including a â€˜build-a-bagâ€™ option, where customers can choose each element of their bag, right down to the colour ofthe zip!

The excitement of dressing up again was a unanimous theme among many designers including Tom Ford, Versace, LaQuan Smith, Christian Siriano and Fendi. New York kicked off Fashion month but ended it in the best way it knows how â€“ â€œFashion&#39;s biggest night outâ€ â€“ The Met Gala, which typically occurs the first Monday of May but was delayed due to covid restrictions. Here, emerging designer Harris Reed made an exceptional debut dressing Iman in a gorgeous gold gown with a feathered halo headpiece. Only graduating from Central Saint Martinâ€™s last year, he has styled Harry Styles (for the infamous Vogue dress cover), grazed Graziaâ€™s recent cover and has his own collaboration with Missoma. His London Fashion Week collection had a lot riding on it, blending the line between menswear and womenswear, fluidity is at the core of his work . Not only were the gowns from his SS22 collection gorgeous but also made using repurposed garments from Oxfam. The collection exhibited elongating silhouettes and tailoring that did justice to the androgynous body. The collection is simply divine and if his work and early success is anything to go by, Harris Reed is a name you should be following.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Notable New York Fashion Week moments included new brand Khaite founded in 2016 whose SS22 collection enthused cool girl chic and a yearning for renewed city life. Leather, bomber jackets, metallic dresses and sequins were all presented with sophistication in looks that seemed made for Rockstarâ€™s. LaQuan Smithâ€™s show must have graced your Instagram feed recently, the first show to be held at the top of the Empire State Building, it encompassed all that is to love about New York: short skirts, barely-there tops and the freedom to be sexy and bold. Tom Ford carried New York nightlife and energy in his collection which really showcased Ford at his best; colourful satin trousers, sequins and metallics stole the show. Michael Kors also debuted a collection that let him play at his best, with simple silhouettes that flatter the female body and an ability to demonstrate that sometimes simplicity is the best way to go, try monochromatic outfits and high waisted skirts. Two more notable designers were Moschino whose Ladies who lunch collection demonstrated how to have fun with fashion; candy land colours and nursery prints were met with suits and workwear appropriate cuts. The final is a designer I came across in lockdown - Ulla Johnson- who creates the most lust worthy dresses, incredible patterns collaborate with balloon sleeves, ruffles, and volume. If I could, my whole summer wardrobe would consist solely of Ulla Johnson dresses, ensuring I was the best dressed guest at every wedding.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Next up is Milan, home to some of the best: Versace, Missoni, Fendi, Prada and Etro. One of the biggest events to come of this week was the hugely speculated and anticipated brand swap â€“ Fendace (Fendi and Versace). The collection created by Donatella and Kim Jones debuted on Sunday evening in what can only be described as a true revival of fashion and creativity at its best, Donatella sure knows how to throw one knockout event. Jones showcased his version of Versace while Donatella put her stamp on Fendi resulting in revamped versions of original prints, accessories, and cuts. Versace also held one of the most talked about shows of fashion week one that screamed girl power, opened by Dua Lipa while her songs were blasting, their iconic safety pins were back, and a neon colour palette and prints contrasted the jet black of other outfits.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The Prada show was the first time we saw Miuccia Prada and Raf Simonsâ€™ collaborated designs in real life. As models made their way down the Milan runway, screens simultaneously showed them in Milan wearing the same looks. The collection really depicted the need to bring sexy back to fashion; miniskirts and more feminine colours were met with utilitarian fabrics such as leather and jackets. Missoni was another collection not to be missed, nobody does colour better than Missoni and if you need inspiration for unexpected colour combinations look to them. Like Prada, the clothes were infused with this idea of showing the body after two years of hiding it away. Clothes tested the boundaries royal blue took centre stage and the classic Missoni print was reinvented into something that felt modern and exciting. Cut outs were used to accentuate these ideas and I couldnâ€™t help but dream of wearing the dresses to a dinner abroad. Fendiâ€™s collection seemed a little mismatched; winter whites were met with tougher blacks and browns, but a spring/summer collection lay in wait, with pastel patterns, lace dresses and colourful fur jackets that have all the drama we need for the next year. The best spring inspiration came through Etro whose vibrant patterns and exaggerated earrings were reminiscent of the 70s.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;We still have Paris Fashion week which starts on the 27 September, Paris being home to top fashion houses such as Dior, Valentino, Hermes, Chanel and Louis Vuitton.

student.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_text\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&lt;p&gt;As students, the term â€˜sustainabilityâ€™ permeates our routine daily. Seminars are often filled gleefully with a sea of reusable cups and the issue of non-recyclable PPE is countered by cotton masks. Speaking more broadly on behalf of the student community, a shift towards plant-based diets is prevalent, as supported University-wide through vegetarian/vegan outlets and menu alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;However, in spite of our collective consciousness, there are still some areas where sustainability still presents a challenge â€“ namely, sustainable eating in the student home. Fresh food and vegetables at supermarkets are still shrouded in plastic. In particular, options most suitable for a student budget and convenience amidst an inevitably busy schedule.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;In response to this, the Food and Drink editors have curated a list of tips and tricks on how to start making small incremental changes to your food consumption. From home planning to your own sustainable shopping guide, food waste in your student houses will soon become a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;strong&gt;Sustainable Shopping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scoop:&lt;/strong&gt; The Student Co-operative (â€˜Scoopâ€™) is a fantastic student-led initiative which aims to reduce waste and squander plastic on a student budget. Based in the heart of Wentworth, Scoop opens every Monday, Wednesday and Friday to offer York staff and students a plethora of sustainable options. Main products include the essential pasta and grains, as well as beans, spices, nuts, dried fruit and non-dairy milks. However, Scoop has expanded their scope over the years to offer a more diverse selection, including organic fruit and vegetable boxes which can be collected weekly.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;For those who are not familiar with Yorkâ€™s postgraduate college, the Scoop committee curated this helpful video guide to show you the way to the store. Be sure to follow their social media pages for updates on opening hours and organic boxes!

Located near the train station, the Bishy Weigh offers all the goodness of the Scoop with the added bonus of sustainable homeware products. Most exciting is their range of sanitisers and cleansers, ranging from toilet cleaner to de-greasers and disinfectants. The cleaning utensils themselves? The Bishy Weigh stock a number of different options made from materials such as bamboo and coconut husk. This also extends to certain toiletries, so why not treat yourself to some plastic-free conditioning bars or bath fizzers next time you need to restock?&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;For more information on independent outlets such as The Bishy Weigh, â€˜Indie Yorkâ€™ is a helpful and frequently updated source which includes a user-friendly map and information on opening times.

Itâ€™s brilliant to shop sustainably, but if half that food goes to waste anyway- things arenâ€™t going as great as youâ€™d like! There are many ways you can make small changes in your household that help the environment and get you more for your money.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meal planning:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the simplest changes you can make happens before youâ€™ve even stepped foot in the supermarket.Â  As students, Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ve all been guilty of aimlessly wandering around a supermarket picking up random items, or even putting off the dreaded â€˜bigâ€™ shop and â€˜grabbing a few bitsâ€™ from the corner shop every couple of days to keep you going. Though sometimes the comfortable grasp of convenience feels like itâ€™s easier, thereâ€™s more benefits than you might think to sitting down and making a proper meal plan before visiting the shops. Planning means that you can think in advance about which ingredients might appear in more than one meal, to reduce food waste and also save money. If you know youâ€™re buying an item for a specific meal, think about what other meal you can make that week to incorporate that ingredient too.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinvent your leftovers:&lt;/strong&gt; Donâ€™t forget, leftovers do not have to be boring! Get creative with the remaining ingredients you have. Whether you cook them off and make into a hearty soup, freeze them to use another day, or even turn them into a whole new meal - there are more possibilities than you think for you to make the most of every part of your ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your freezer is your best friend:&lt;/strong&gt; If youâ€™re anything like me, you might randomly get a craving for toast one day but wonâ€™t use the rest of the loaf - you can freeze the whole loaf and defrost what you need as and when. The same goes for reduced items in the shops, thereâ€™s so many occasions when items are reduced because they have reached their sell-by date and you can pick up a bargain that can live in the freezer until you need to use it . Itâ€™s also important to know the difference between your dates, whilst you should pay attention to use buy dates, particularly on high risk foods, best before dates have a lot more flexibility - especially with fresh vegetables!

Seminars are often filled gleefully with a sea of reusable cups and the issue of non-recyclable PPE is countered by cotton masks. Speaking more broadly on behalf of the student community, a shift towards plant-based diets is prevalent, as supported University-wide through vegetarian/vegan outlets and menu alternatives.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHowever, in spite of our collective consciousness, there are still some areas where sustainability still presents a challenge â€“ namely, sustainable eating in the student home. Fresh food and vegetables at supermarkets are still shrouded in plastic. In particular, options most suitable for a student budget and convenience amidst an inevitably busy schedule.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIn response to this, the Food and Drink editors have curated a list of tips and tricks on how to start making small incremental changes to your food consumption. From home planning to your own sustainable shopping guide, food waste in your student houses will soon become a thing of the past.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;br&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n**Sustainable Shopping**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n**Scoop:** The Student Co-operative (â€˜Scoopâ€™) is a fantastic student-led initiative which aims to reduce waste and squander plastic on a student budget. Based in the heart of Wentworth, Scoop opens every Monday, Wednesday and Friday to offer York staff and students a plethora of sustainable options. Main products include the essential pasta and grains, as well as beans, spices, nuts, dried fruit and non-dairy milks. However, Scoop has expanded their scope over the years to offer a more diverse selection, including organic fruit and vegetable boxes which can be collected weekly.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFor those who are not familiar with Yorkâ€™s postgraduate college, the Scoop committee curated this helpful video guide to show you the way to the store. Be sure to follow their social media pages for updates on opening hours and organic boxes! You can access the video here: [https://www.instagram.com/tv/CUupdFxlb5E/?utm\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_source=ig\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_web\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_copy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_link](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CUupdFxlb5E/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFind Scoop on the YUSU website: [https://yusu.org/activities/view/scoop](https://yusu.org/activities/view/scoop).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n**The Bishy Weigh, Bishopthorpe:** In addition to the University co-operative, the Bishy Weigh at Bishopthorpe offers a similar option with the advantage of being a larger enterprise. Located near the train station, the Bishy Weigh offers all the goodness of the Scoop with the added bonus of sustainable homeware products. Most exciting is their range of sanitisers and cleansers, ranging from toilet cleaner to de-greasers and disinfectants. The cleaning utensils themselves? The Bishy Weigh stock a number of different options made from materials such as bamboo and coconut husk. This also extends to certain toiletries, so why not treat yourself to some plastic-free conditioning bars or bath fizzers next time you need to restock?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFor more information on independent outlets such as The Bishy Weigh, â€˜Indie Yorkâ€™ is a helpful and frequently updated source which includes a user-friendly map and information on opening times.

Itâ€™s brilliant to shop sustainably, but if half that food goes to waste anyway- things arenâ€™t going as great as youâ€™d like! There are many ways you can make small changes in your household that help the environment and get you more for your money.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n**Meal planning:** One of the simplest changes you can make happens before youâ€™ve even stepped foot in the supermarket.Â  As students, Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ve all been guilty of aimlessly wandering around a supermarket picking up random items, or even putting off the dreaded â€˜bigâ€™ shop and â€˜grabbing a few bitsâ€™ from the corner shop every couple of days to keep you going. Though sometimes the comfortable grasp of convenience feels like itâ€™s easier, thereâ€™s more benefits than you might think to sitting down and making a proper meal plan before visiting the shops. Planning means that you can think in advance about which ingredients might appear in more than one meal, to reduce food waste and also save money. If you know youâ€™re buying an item for a specific meal, think about what other meal you can make that week to incorporate that ingredient too.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n**Reinvent your leftovers:** Donâ€™t forget, leftovers do not have to be boring! Get creative with the remaining ingredients you have. Whether you cook them off and make into a hearty soup, freeze them to use another day, or even turn them into a whole new meal - there are more possibilities than you think for you to make the most of every part of your ingredients.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n**Your freezer is your best friend:** If youâ€™re anything like me, you might randomly get a craving for toast one day but wonâ€™t use the rest of the loaf - you can freeze the whole loaf and defrost what you need as and when. The same goes for reduced items in the shops, thereâ€™s so many occasions when items are reduced because they have reached their sell-by date and you can pick up a bargain that can live in the freezer until you need to use it . Itâ€™s also important to know the difference between your dates, whilst you should pay attention to use buy dates, particularly on high risk foods, best before dates have a lot more flexibility - especially with fresh vegetables!

experiencing a â€˜cost of living crisisâ€™; a simplistic definition of what that means, is â€œa scenario in which the cost of everyday essentials like energy and food is rising much faster than average incomes.â€ Consequently, this has led to devastating struggles for a large proportion of the population and has added to the anxiety of the coming winter months.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;We all know studentsâ€™ money can be tight. Between the rise of accommodation costs in both the university and private sector and the increasing food and energy prices, some struggle more than others and this crisis is only making matters worse. Even with a full maintenance loan, it can be exceedingly harder to make ends meet. Itâ€™s at times like these when creative money management is essential and leaning on each-other for support is always encouraged. Therefore, in this piece, I am going to give some tips for saving some extra money on your food shop whilst also showcasing some of the best places for your purchases!&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheaper places to buy essentials:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Two of the best places to buy your groceries for less are of course Aldi and Lidl. According to â€˜Whichâ€™ in June of this year, Aldi was Â£1.38 cheaper than Lidl when they bought the same groceries in each. Everyday essentials at both supermarkets are significantly more affordable than other leading supermarkets; the study presentedÂ the next cheapest supermarket to be Asda, but it was almost Â£10 more than Aldi/Lidl for the same groceries. Luckily here in York, we have a large Aldi and Lidl both easily accessible for most students as they are each a 25-minute walk from Campus West. Although the two campuses Nisaâ€™s and the Hull Road Co- op are convenient and much closer than either of these supermarkets, they are significantly more expensive for very similar products. I recommend trying to do one or two big weekly shops at either Aldi or Lidl so that you can avoid having to run into the Nisa regularly. It can seem like a pain but honestly my flatmates and I have had some great times heading out to do our weekly shops â€” just try and avoid persuading each other into buying more than needed (I may or may not have returned to my house with 2 tins of Heroes chocolates after my friend convinced me the 2 for Â£7 deal was an essential purchase!) Creating a grocery list in advance can help you avoid unnecessary purchases and even splitting and sharing groceries with a housemate can help to cut your weekly bill and decrease wastage. Remember, by shopping at Aldi and/or Lidl you end up saving more money which can be put towards bills or some extra treats with friends!&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food and Drink Places that offer student discounts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;As important as it is to save money it is equally as important to put a little aside to enjoy nights out and/or coffee dates with friends!Â Therefore, heading to places that offer deals on food and drink or student discounts can be a lifesaver. One of the first places that offer a 10% student discount is â€˜Drift Inâ€™. Serving up a wide assortment of delicious food, coffee, and desserts â€˜Drift Inâ€™ is the perfect place to catch up with friends. Offering a 10% discount with a valid university card further elevates this cafeÌ and can help ease some worries about spending money when choosing to eat out. Furthermore, when having a takeaway spend some time exploring Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat offers for that week. There are always new promotions on the apps and in stores too. Also, remember to check your UNiDAYS for restaurant and grocery promotions; for example, Pizza Express and Las Iguanas are currently offering 30% off food Thursday to Sunday!&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips for making your money go further:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Buy items with best before dates rather than use by where possible â€” even if food is past its best before date, it is often still fine to eat, if it looks fine, it usually is. However, use the â€˜smell testâ€™ with use by items but be careful and if youâ€™re unsure donâ€™t eat it, it is better to be safe than wake up with food poisoning when you have a 9am lecture!&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Shop in the evening when supermarkets reduce prices based on dates. When purchasing a reduced item, check if it can be frozen. Freezing it may affect the foodâ€™s quality but it will still be safe to eat at a later date as long as it was frozen within the â€˜use byâ€™ period.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Buy versatile essentials such as pasta and rice to easily bulk up meals. Tinned items such as chopped tomatoes and beans are also great for creating filling meals&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Use your judgement when deciding if fruit and veg are out of date. Often the date on the packaging is advising on the quality of the food. If the fruit/veg isnâ€™t mouldy itâ€™s normally still ok to eat&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Boil your kettle and fill a flask for hot water to last longer throughout the day&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Cook meals in bulk and freeze them; also saving you time in the long run&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Cut back on all types of takeaways â€” this doesnâ€™t mean never buy coffee in town or a takeaway with your friends as itâ€™s important to put money aside to enjoy little treats.

Historic shots of the city sat awkwardly next to kitsch Americana, I couldnâ€™t quite work out if they were meant to be ironic. A â€˜Lifeâ€™s too short to drink cheap wineâ€™ sign hung smugly next to the specials board; I hadnâ€™t an idea why.

Very enjoyable, if a little undercooked, each pocket was filled with an indiscriminate blend of meats and steamed winter vegetables. I think one of which may have been beef, though it was impossible to tell from either taste or sight. Served alongside was a heavily whipped sour cream. Tangy and bold, yet with a nuance that would be impossible to recreate on a large scale. I donâ€™t intend this as a criticism, as by some distance this is the most delicious item on the menu.

newly openned Pho, where value for money and fresh ingredients is priority\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_text\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&lt;p&gt;Sick and tired of eating the same cuisine every time you decide to eat out? Why not try one of York&#39;s newest restaurants, Pho. Specialising in Vietnamese street-style food, Pho is a â€œsmall group of restaurants... serving great value, healthy Vietnamese food thatâ€™s cooked fresh...daily.â€ Pho was first imagined when founders, Stephen and Juliette Wall, visited Vietnam in 2005 and fell in love with the unique flavours of Vietnamese culture; they returned to England and opened their restaurant inspired by their new-found love. 17 years later, we now have our very own Pho in York situated on Low Petergate and early reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. Therefore, when their marketing team reached out to my co-editor (Henry Howard) and myself about coming in for a complimentary meal and a subsequent review, we couldnâ€™t wait to give the food a try.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly, on entering the restaurant there was a calm, clean ambience created through the simple, yet effective Vietnamese-inspired deÌcor. The song playlist in particular was perfect and complimented the style of the restaurant. As someone new to Vietnamese food I was quite apprehensive. But from the moment we stepped into the restaurant, the staff were attentive and excellent at guiding us through the different courses of our meal. This was greatly appreciated, as the volume of choices was a littleÂ overwhelming. Our server, Megan, was brilliant at talking us through each option on the menu, recommending some of their most popular dishes and some personal favourites too. To start I ordered a â€˜Lemon &amp;amp; Basil Martiniâ€™ â€“ HaÌ€ Ná»Ì‚i vodka, homemade lemonade &amp;amp; Thai basil (Â£7.95); the blast of the fresh lemonade and vodka made for a spicy, tangy concoction, which was perfectly balanced with the fragrant, sweeter basil. Next, I tried the â€˜Pride Punchâ€™ â€“ Havana Club rum, passionfruit liqueur, fresh apple juice and muddled lime (Â£7.95). Juxtaposing the flavours of the martini, the Pride Punch really did pack a punch; the sweetly vivacious flavour of the passionfruit along with the tart apple has made this drink one of Phoâ€™s most popular. The best thing about this cocktail is that 50p is donated to StonewallÂ (an LGBTQ+ rights charity in the UK) with every purchase.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding our food choices, on the whole, everything we tried was delicious. I started my meal with the vegan â€˜Morning Glory | Rau muÃ´Ìng xaÌ€oâ€™; stir-fried morning glory (water spinach) in garlic, with or without fresh red chillies (Â£5.95), which was seasoned perfectly, enhancing the freshness of the vegetables. Henry ordered the â€˜BabyÂ squid | MÆ°Ì£c chieÌ‚n gioÌ€nâ€™; tender fried baby squidÂ with a salt, pepper &amp;amp; lime dip (Â£7.95); the batter was light and crispy and just like everything we tried, super fresh.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://nouse.co.uk/image/?f=6414&amp;amp;s=large&amp;amp;r=true\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; alt=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;6414\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; /&gt;The &#39;Morning Glory&#39; starter and the &#39;Baby Squid&#39;. Image: Emma McGreevy&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Next up, we both opted for PhÆ¡Ì‰ options; I tried the â€˜PhÆ¡Ì‰ house | PhÆ¡Ì‰ Ä‘áº¡Ì†c biáº¹Ì‚tâ€™-king prawns, chicken &amp;amp; flash-fried steak with garlic in beef broth (Â£12.95) and Henry had the â€˜Crab noodle soup | BuÌn rieÌ‚uâ€™ - a Hanoi classic; vermicelli noodles in a tomato &amp;amp; crab broth with wafer thin steak and tofu, topped with fried shallots (Â£12.50). Similarly, to the â€˜Pride Punchâ€™, a highlight of the menu is that a 25p donation is given to the Christina Noble Childrenâ€™s Foundation in Vietnam every time the â€˜Pho Houseâ€™ is ordered. PhÆ¡Ì‰ is a Vietnamese soup consisting of broth, noodles, meat or alternative and lots of toppings. It is a highly aromatic dish that is filled with delicate spice-infused flavours. Our experience of PhÆ¡Ì‰ lived up to the dishesâ€™ prestigious reviews. The â€˜PhÆ¡Ì‰ houseâ€™ was light and tangy whereas the â€˜Crab noodle soupâ€™ was a much richer dish; each equally as fragrant, flavoursome, and filled with toppings. On the side was a dish of extra herbs and toppings, allowing us to tailor the meal to our taste; Megan had explained that this was an integral part of the experience and so each table supplied a selection of fish sauce, garlic chilli oil, sriracha and soy sauce to add if desired. With regards to value for money, each portion was significantly large and filling. By the end of the main course, I was comfortably satisfied and so turned down the dessert offer (unheard of, for me!). We finished our experience with a CaÌ€ pheÌ‚ sÆ°Ìƒa Ä‘aÌ; an iced coffee with condensed milk (Â£3.60), which was very indulgent. The condensed milk counterbalanced the bitter, robust coffee creating a creamy iced treat once mixed.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Concerning allergens, Pho provides an extensive list of specific allergens in each dish online and has a wide variety of options for everyone. What is particularly impressive is that the menu is almost entirely Gluten-free as accredited by â€˜Coeliac UKâ€™. As well as this, Megan asked us immediately if we had any allergens or food preferences when we sat down which is always appreciated. Regarding vegetarian and vegan options, the online menu has a separate substantial section for these items creating a restaurant that is welcoming to all.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, we had a thoroughly enjoyable experience visiting Pho and we were very well taken care of. Its value for money, vibrant, fresh food and impeccable service makes it a must-visit; I will definitely be back soon to try their crispy banana fritters!&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Sick and tired of eating the same cuisine every time you decide to eat out?

Next, I tried the â€˜Pride Punchâ€™ â€“ Havana Club rum, passionfruit liqueur, fresh apple juice and muddled lime (Â£7.95). Juxtaposing the flavours of the martini, the Pride Punch really did pack a punch; the sweetly vivacious flavour of the passionfruit along with the tart apple has made this drink one of Phoâ€™s most popular. The best thing about this cocktail is that 50p is donated to StonewallÂ (an LGBTQ+ rights charity in the UK) with every purchase.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nRegarding our food choices\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, on the whole\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, everything we tried was delicious\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. I started my meal with the vegan â€˜Morning Glory \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\| Rau muÃ´Ìng xaÌ€oâ€™; stir\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\-fried morning glory \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(water spinach\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) in garlic\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, with or without fresh red chillies \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(Â£5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.95\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, which was seasoned perfectly\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, enhancing the freshness of the vegetables\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Henry ordered the â€˜BabyÂ squid \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\| MÆ°Ì£c chieÌ‚n gioÌ€nâ€™; tender fried baby squidÂ with a salt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, pepper &amp; lime dip \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(Â£7\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.95\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\); the batter was light and crispy and just like everything we tried\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, super fresh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n![6414](https://nouse.co.uk/image/?f=6414&amp;s=large&amp;r=true)The &#39;Morning Glory&#39; starter and the &#39;Baby Squid&#39;. Image: Emma McGreevy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext up\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, we both opted for PhÆ¡Ì‰ options; I tried the â€˜PhÆ¡Ì‰ house \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\| PhÆ¡Ì‰ Ä‘áº¡Ì†c biáº¹Ì‚tâ€™\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\-king prawns\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, chicken &amp; flash\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\-fried steak with garlic in beef broth \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(Â£12\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.95\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and Henry had the â€˜Crab noodle soup \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\| BuÌn rieÌ‚uâ€™ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- a Hanoi classic; vermicelli noodles in a tomato &amp; crab broth with wafer thin steak and tofu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, topped with fried shallots \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(Â£12\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.50\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Similarly\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, to the â€˜Pride Punchâ€™\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, a highlight of the menu is that a 25p donation is given to the Christina Noble Childrenâ€™s Foundation in Vietnam every time the â€˜Pho Houseâ€™ is ordered\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. PhÆ¡Ì‰ is a Vietnamese soup consisting of broth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, noodles\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, meat or alternative and lots of toppings\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. It is a highly aromatic dish that is filled with delicate spice\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\-infused flavours\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. Our experience of PhÆ¡Ì‰ lived up to the dishesâ€™ prestigious reviews\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. The â€˜PhÆ¡Ì‰ houseâ€™ was light and tangy whereas the â€˜Crab noodle soupâ€™ was a much richer dish; each equally as fragrant\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, flavoursome\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, and filled with toppings\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. On the side was a dish of extra herbs and toppings\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, allowing us to tailor the meal to our taste; Megan had explained that this was an integral part of the experience and so each table supplied a selection of fish sauce\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, garlic chilli oil\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, sriracha and soy sauce to add if desired\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. With regards to value for money\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, each portion was significantly large and filling\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. By the end of the main course\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, I was comfortably satisfied and so turned down the dessert offer \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(unheard of\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, for me\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. We finished our experience with a CaÌ€ pheÌ‚ sÆ°Ìƒa Ä‘aÌ; an iced coffee with condensed milk \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(Â£3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.60\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, which was very indulgent\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. The condensed milk counterbalanced the bitter\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, robust coffee creating a creamy iced treat once mixed\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nConcerning allergens, Pho provides an extensive list of specific allergens in each dish online and has a wide variety of options for everyone. What is particularly impressive is that the menu is almost entirely Gluten-free as accredited by â€˜Coeliac UKâ€™. As well as this, Megan asked us immediately if we had any allergens or food preferences when we sat down which is always appreciated. Regarding vegetarian and vegan options, the online menu has a separate substantial section for these items creating a restaurant that is welcoming to all.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOverall, we had a thoroughly enjoyable experience visiting Pho and we were very well taken care of. Its value for money, vibrant, fresh food and impeccable service makes it a must-visit; I will definitely be back soon to try their crispy banana fritters!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_infoBox\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_thumbnailCredit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Emma McGreevy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_changelog\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_googleAppsUsernameYork\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;emm599\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_googleAppsUsernameNouse\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;emma.mcgreevy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_name1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Emma\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_name2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;McGreevy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_userid\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,148486],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_created\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;2022-07-19T13:46:47.000Z\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_notes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_thumbnail\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;6222\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_changepass\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_deleted\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_suspended\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_facebook\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_twitter\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_instagram\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_linkedin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_snapchat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_bio\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_archive_username\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_archive_email\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articles_featured\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_pronouns\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null]}]}]]\\\\\\\&quot;]}],[0,{\\\\\\\&quot;articles_id\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,151099],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_categories\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;4,169,1878\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_authors\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;148562\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_published\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\&quot;2022-12-12T17:35:56.000Z\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;editions_id\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_editionPage\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_updated\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\&quot;2022-12-12T17:38:46.000Z\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInLists\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInSearch\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInAdmin\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_type\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_slug\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;review-sylhety-lounge\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_extraMetadata\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_thumbnail\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;6596\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_lifetimeViews\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,63],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_archiveFallback\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_socialConfig\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;1,1,1,1\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_mediaCharterDone\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_socialExcerpt\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_dropCapital\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_displayImages\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_isThumbnailPortrait\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts\\\\\\\&quot;:[1,\\\\\\\&quot;[[0,{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,814436],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articles_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,151099],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_timestamp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;2022-12-12T17:38:46.000Z\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_userid\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,148486],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_headline\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Review: Sylhety Lounge\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_excerpt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Alex Chase (he/him) reviews Sylhety Lounge: The Best Bangladeshi in Badger Hill.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_text\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&lt;p&gt;Were you to look up Sylhety Lounge on Google, it would tell you it is an â€˜Indian restaurantâ€™. Whilst I enjoy Indian food, I should not claim any expertise in it, seeing as I once tried to spice up a Korma by using beef mince, which Iâ€™m pretty sure is an act of sacrilege. However, Iâ€™m going to make the bold claim that Google is absolutely wrong to call it an â€˜Indian Restaurantâ€™. Why? Well for starters, the sign above the door says it is actually â€˜Bangladeshi and Sub-continental cuisineâ€™. While there are Indian staples in there such as the Biriyani (although it should be mentioned that it was invented by Iranian immigrants in Mumbai), a lot of the food comes from other countries in the Asian subcontinent and even further afield.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;If you live or have lived, on or near East Campus, youâ€™ve probably come across it. Sylhety is tucked away in a corner on Kimberlow Rise, next to Cecilâ€™s (which is less of a restaurant and more of an experience, but thatâ€™s a topic for another day). Since this was the closest place to campus restaurant-wise, my father and I gave it a visit when he came to York last June. Now it was an early dinner, so we were expecting to be alone in the restaurant, and for the awkward shuffling of cutlery to be audible to the poor waiter who would have nothing to do. To our surprise, however, the restaurant was at the perfect capacity, not so busy that we could not hear one another, but not so empty that everyone could hear our conversation. Weirdly, of the four other groups of diners (one group of which was a party of eight, well seated in the centre) not a single other person was a student; despite the generous student discount for takeaways. In spite of this sentiment, there is a weird element of student dÃ©cor to their setup, for example, there is a set of multicoloured LED strip lights in one of the corners. In my opinion, It doesnâ€™t gel very well with the rest of the interior, which is an average modern curry restaurant affair: white and blue cloth tables, bare walls and low lighting. I am not saying that this is a point against them, I just found it unusual that most of it looks like a restaurant, but in one corner it looks like someoneâ€™s going to be filming a TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;However, none of that matters, because the food steals the show (as indeed it should!) Sylhety Lounge absolutely basks in their knowledge of Subcontinental Asian cuisine, and the amount of care they have put into replicating these flavours is a testament to this.Â Itâ€™s advised that you get about two or three of the meals to share as well as some rice and naan/chapati to mop them up. Of course, if you want some starters, they offer some very generous platters of various tasters such as kebabs and samosas for about Â£5; I took full advantage of this! On the curry side, while the Garlic Chilli Balti was delightful, I want to draw particular attention to one of their speciality dishes; the Haandi. While a nice lamb dish for less than Â£8 will catch my eye regardless, what interested me was the story behind it. This is a dish brought to prominence because of the Mongol Emperors, who apparently said that â€˜eating with a knife and fork is like making love through an interpreterâ€™. This odd detail was enough to pique my interest, and I am glad that I chose the dish. There was a fantastic array of textures, flavours and spices. They really put some punch into these dishes, so you will certainly be drinking more water than you would with your average supermarket curry sauce.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Having looked through the menu again in retrospect, I must admit, I found myself salivating thinking about the seafood section. Subcontinental Asian restaurants arenâ€™t renowned for fish, but Sylhety shows the wonderful diversity of seafood recipes from the Subcontinent, and I regret not having gone for their Monkfish or the King Prawn Hashnaji. Vegetarians will also find themselves served rather nicely by Sylhety lounge, with many meat-free recreations of the main dishes. I will say that vegans have slightly less wiggle room, but Iâ€™m sure that the ever-helpful staff will do their best to accommodate.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of, the staff were fantastic. They were very friendly, came around at appropriate moments and did a fantastic job of getting all the dishes onto an admittedly small table (bear in mind this was a table for two). They even granted my request to get what remained on my plate transferred into some Tupperware (the food tasted just as nice two days later as well!) While the restaurant is perfect for getting takeaway from, I would feel guilty if you ate from this place without allowing the wonderful staff an opportunity to earn their well-deserved service charge.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;If ever you need a nice meal and donâ€™t want to hop on a bus, then this is the place. It wonâ€™t set you back much in terms of price, since most of their best options plus rice come to less than Â£10, and so if you order with a few friends, you wonâ€™t find yourself breaking the bank in the name of flavour.

Once golden, toss the onion in the paprika, cinnamon, ginger and curry powder and cook for a further minute.&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;Add the chopped tomatoes, sweet potato, coconut milk, chickpeas, tomato puree and salt. (If youâ€™re using frozen spinach cubes add them at this point too). Stir all of the ingredients in then bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;Leave the curry to simmer for 35-40 minutes, or until the sweet potato is soft. Once ready, if youâ€™re using fresh spinach, stir this in.&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;Serve up and enjoy! I usually enjoy the curry with coconut microwave rice and naan bread!

It does require a little more effort than the other recipes as itâ€™s important to not let the rice stick to the bottom of the pan, but I promise it is worth the extra work. This recipe serves four hearty portions, so when making it just for me I like to freeze the other portions (they last about three months in the freezer). Just defrost them in the fridge overnight and they are ready to go!&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Recipe serves: 4&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Ingredients&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;2 tbsp olive oil&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;2 garlic cloves (crushed)&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;1 large red onion (diced)&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;2 mixed peppers (chopped into small pieces)&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;300g risotto rice (I like to use Arborio)&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;1 Â½ - 2Â  litres of vegetable stock cube.

However, I regularly make it without wine and it still tastes delicious so really itâ€™s just up to personal preference (and possibly how tight the purse strings are that week)&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Optional protein: I love adding king prawns or chicken.

Soften for about 2-3 minutes on medium heat to avoid burning the garlic.&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;Stir the rice into the pan and turn off the heat. Add some boiling water or if youâ€™re feeling fancy some white wine to coat the rice and stir continuously until it reduces a little.&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;Add the peppers and gradually the stock, ensuring the rice is coated. Allow to simmer on low-medium heat for 22-25 minutes whilst continuously stirring the rice every few minutes. As the stock reduces gradually add the rest of it until the rice is tender and creamy. Remember to continue to stir even when the stock has been absorbed as this is when the rice can stick to the bottom of the pan.&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;Lower the heat and add in the frozen peas, optional protein and salt and pepper to taste. Stir for an extra 5 minutes or until the peas have defrosted.&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;Add any additional toppings and enjoy!&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;strong&gt;Quick and tasty Butterbean Stew&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;This flavourful stew is so simple and quick, making it the perfect meal to bulk cook and freeze.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Recipe serves: 2 (double everything but the oil to bulk cook)&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Ingredients&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;2 tbsp olive oil&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Â½ tin butter beans or chickpeas&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;95g mushrooms&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;1 brown onion&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;30g frozen peas&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Â½ can chopped tomatoes&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;1-2 tbsp soy sauce&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;1-2 tbsp lemon juice&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;1-2 garlic clove&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;2-3 tsp cumin&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;2 tsp smoked paprika&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Optional protein: 1 Chicken breast or any chosen meat/ protein alternative&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Method&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;Peel and finely chop the onion.

travel journals and the ethics of journaling historically sensitive subjects.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_text\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&lt;p&gt;It could be argued that the travel journal began life as the humble travel blog. In the early2010s, travel blogs were popping up every-where and were duly bound to include a profile picture of a windswept yet earnest traveller set to a backdrop of cascading mountains and vales. All jokes aside, travel blogs became an essential companion for many travellers, providing both practical and money saving tips as a way of making people&#39;s travel goals a reality.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;We may see this type of traveller as one who &#39;travels to journal&#39;. From the moment they step into the airport, they are primed to collect various souvenirs from their experience: ripped tickets, polaroids â€“ even something as trivial as a paper tea bag casing which is unique to their host country. Whilst nothing can match the exciting exhilaration of exploring a new city, a memento such as small as a photograph can help remind us of that feeling when the trip has come to an end.

In the early2010s, travel blogs were popping up every-where and were duly bound to include a profile picture of a windswept yet earnest traveller set to a backdrop of cascading mountains and vales. All jokes aside, travel blogs became an essential companion for many travellers, providing both practical and money saving tips as a way of making people&#39;s travel goals a reality.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe may see this type of traveller as one who &#39;travels to journal&#39;. From the moment they step into the airport, they are primed to collect various souvenirs from their experience: ripped tickets, polaroids â€“ even something as trivial as a paper tea bag casing which is unique to their host country. Whilst nothing can match the exciting exhilaration of exploring a new city, a memento such as small as a photograph can help remind us of that feeling when the trip has come to an end. In doing so, the traveller may then reflection their experiences and, with their many points of reference, produce a form of guide, whether this be written formally or as a series of tokens presented to anyone interested in their journey (the scrapbook is an old-school favourite!)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nInevitably, such pragmatic foundations were infiltrated slowly by a yearning for the aesthetic side of travel.

Whether it is a trip far across the world, a quick getaway to a European city or somewhere just a train ride away, Iâ€™ve got you covered with my top four places to visit this summer.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St Andrews:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe first is St Andrews (yes, Scotland!)I think Scotland is one of the most beautiful places in the world. But its crown jewel, with some of the kindest people and best hospitality, is St Andrews, a must visit destination in Scotland if you are looking for a nice weekend getaway. St Andrews is a scenic seaside town that is only an hour away by train from Edinburgh (you could always combine visiting the two!) The cute independent shops are enough to attract you to the town with bakeries, jewellers, bookshops, and even bottle shops! Luvians bottle shop is a must-visit if you are a whisky fan! And last but not least, if you love golf, I donâ€™t think I even need to say this but; St Andrews is the home of golf.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisbon:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nUp next is the beautiful city of Lisbon. Possibly prettier than St. Andrews, Lisbon is one of the most beautiful places I have visited. From the small, hilly streets nestled in the Alfama area to the bustling and vibrant streets in the city centre, you cannot help but fall in love with this place! The best thing you can do in Lisbon is walk. You will see so many more places just by walking through the city rather than using transport, including the Rua Augusta Arch, one of the most beautiful landmarks I have seen. Found at the northern end of the PraÃ§ado ComÃ©rcio, the arch represents Lisbonâ€™s recovery after the devastating 1755 earthquake. Every morning, I walked under the arch and wandered up the Rua Augusta, meeting locals and searching for traditional Portuguese restaurants. However, if you donâ€™t feel like walking there is a beautiful tram network that runs throughout the city, giving you the luxury of being able to hop on and off at many different locations. If you donâ€™t mind queuing, the Elevador de Santa Justa is a must-visit, with incredible views waiting for everyone at the top. Finally, if you are in need of a place to eat, I can not recommend enough places. But if you are to try one, the Time Out Market is incredible, with a huge range of cuisines under one roof.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sicily:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNumber three on the list is Sicily, a perfect example of beautiful, authentic Italy. I visited Sciacca on the southwest coast of the island. Its incredible restaurants are only defeated by the view you get watching the sunset over the sea on the promenade. Sicily also has the luxury of having two major cities that offer two completely different vibes. Catania is situated in the shadow of Mount Etna, an active volcano, with aesthetic buildings and various cobbled streets, it is meant to make any traveller fall in love, with endless at-tractions for people to see! On the other side of the island, is the rival city to Catania; Palermo. Palermo is the biggest city in Sicily and has a rich history that makes it even more interesting. Much like Catania, there are loads of places to see and many photo opportunities that would make anyone jealous of your Sicilian getaway.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Los Angeles:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFinally, if you are after somewhere a bit further away, LA is the place for you! What I love about this city is it has something for everyone. If shopping is your thing, head to Beverly Hills and you may even see a famous housewife or two! However, if you are after a more downtown experience, then the Hollywood boulevard is the place to be. Not only will you get to seethe Hollywood Walk of Fame, which you can spend hours walking up and down looking for your favourite celebrity star, but you will also see the famous TCL Chinese Theatre and the Dolby Theatre (where they hold the Oscars!)Venturing west, head to the Santa Monica Pier and Venice Beach, two places definitely worth visiting if you are looking for a classic tourist photo and a relax in the sun. You might even be tempted to work out on the beach with some of the LA locals, too!&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;I could carry on forever recommending places to travel to this summer, but Iâ€™m afraid I have no space! These are four of the most beautiful and fascinating places I have had the privilege of visiting and I hope you get to make a journey to at least one of these locations, I hope to hear all about it!&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Summer is mere months away and many people have still not been able to go abroad or enjoy a nice relaxing holiday since the pandemic started back in March 2020 (I know I havenâ€™t!)

However, sometimes it is nice to be able to travel. With its rich cultural history and stunning architecture, Edinburgh is immensely popular with students from across the UK for a quick weekend getaway. Moreover, Edinburgh is well connected via the Edinburgh to London King&#39;s Cross railway line, making it easily accessible from across the country. And conveniently for students here at York, York railway station is perfectly placed on this line. Travelling up only takes a couple of hours at most - yet that doesnâ€™t mean it is a cheap ride. To make the cost more affordable, here are a few tips to reduce the price:&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;If possible, split up the journey into multiple tickets, which can help bring down the cost.&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;Book them as early as you can and do it at the station in person. The friendly staff will try to help you find the best deals.&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;Have a railcard! Whatâ€™s better than getting money off any train ticket you ever buy?&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;li&gt;Additionally, to save more money whilst travelling, have a sandwich, a drink and a couple of snacks packed from home instead of paying for something overpriced on the way.&lt;/li&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;When you arrive in Edinburgh, you may be tempted to head straight to all the fantastic places there are to visit, but one of the first things I like to do is check out where I am going to be staying. Whether that is to check in, put bags away or just so you can locate it again later at night. One of the cheapest ways to stay overnight is in hostels or pod hotels and there are a couple of these in well situated spots throughout the city. However, there are always the options of an Air-bnb, a regular B&amp;amp;B or a hotel room if youâ€™re savvy at finding the best deals! Iâ€™ve found that with more people to share the costs of the stay, a hostel may be the most affordable option, leaving you with more money to spend elsewhere. Whilst I would feel a little weird sharing a room with complete strangers, I canâ€™t imagine anything more fun than going with friends and taking over an entire dorm.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Once youâ€™ve checked out your accommodation, it is now time to explore the city. The Writerâ€™s Museum has free entry and is situated in Lady Stairâ€™s house on the Royal Mile. Exploring three prominent Scottish authors: Robert Louis Stevenson, Robert Burns and Walter Scott, there is plenty of information about their lives through the museum&#39;s displays of portraiture, personal objects (such as Burnsâ€™ writing desk) and literary works. If youâ€™re into art, the Scottish National Portrait gallery also has free admission but booking is strongly advised as it is a popular tourist location and is in the centre of the city. Sadly due to the ongoing pandemic, the gallery has remained closed to visitors with no indication of an opening date, however with restrictions gradually being lifted, it hopefully wonâ€™t be too long before it opens its doors again.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;There are lots of free places to visit, like Scottâ€™s Monument or the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. Both are very striking places to visit â€“ especially in the summer. From the Royal Mile, the Gardens are a 31 minute walk but despite the distance, itâ€™s a perfect opportunity to take in the sights and explore the city on the way. And if youâ€™re really into your views, then Arthurâ€™s Seat is a fantastic place to trek up, taking around two hours to reach the top of the ancient volcanic summit, when you reach the top there are fantastic views of the city which make for a perfect photo opportunity. And theyâ€™re not the only free tourist attractions; there are plenty more to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;If youâ€™re looking for a tour of the city with a twist, for Â£14 per adult, instead of exploring Edinburgh&#39;s streets, you can descend below and into the vaults. The Underground Walking Tour in Edinburgh comes with an accompanying guide and you can purchase the tickets via your mobile through trip advisor or on the Visit Scotland website. It takes around an hour to complete. If this sounds like your thing, then the Edinburgh Dungeons should also be on your itinerary. An adult ticket is a little pricey; however, according to TripAdvisor, it has a professional theatrical cast, special effects, rides and plenty of immersive experiences. So be prepared to be spooked!&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;For something a bit different, situated in the Outlook Tower in the Castle Hill region of the Royal Mile, The Camera Obscura &amp;amp; World of Illusions is filled with interactive optical illusions. Due to COVID-19, you have to book online in order to enter, but it is fairly easy to do! Per their website, students can get in at the reduced cost when booking and bringing a student ID card as verification, which is definitely a perk!&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;However, you simply cannot visit Edinburgh without taking a look into the Greyfriars Kirkyard, a deeply emotive and quintessentially gothic graveyard that inspired many of the character names from the Harry Potter series. Keep your eyes peeled for the headstone of Tom Riddle. Finally, Deanâ€™s village is all over Instagram at the moment, and truly gives off dark academia vibes. With its 19th century buildings, dramatic landscape and winding river, it truly is a great place to unwind with a coffee and a book â€“ or just to take some pictures.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The list doesnâ€™t stop there, there are plenty more places to visit! But when travelling student friendly, one of the best things you can do is have a budget and be wary of it throughout your trip. Whilst it&#39;s good to live spontaneously, there&#39;s also great benefits in having a few ideas about activities before travelling to places so you know what to bring. With endless places to explore and all doable on a student budget, I hope this guide is helpful to any student thinking about heading up to Edinburgh. It is a beautiful city with a rich history that would make the perfect weekend getaway after the exam season.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;As students, it&#39;s safe to say we donâ€™t often have much spare cash, and when we do, we usually like to spend it on going out to bars and clubs with friends, or indulging in all of the lovely bakeries and cafes in York. However, sometimes it is nice to be able to travel. With its rich cultural history and stunning architecture, Edinburgh is immensely popular with students from across the UK for a quick weekend getaway. Moreover, Edinburgh is well connected via the Edinburgh to London King&#39;s Cross railway line, making it easily accessible from across the country. And conveniently for students here at York, York railway station is perfectly placed on this line. Travelling up only takes a couple of hours at most - yet that doesnâ€™t mean it is a cheap ride. To make the cost more affordable, here are a few tips to reduce the price:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* If possible, split up the journey into multiple tickets, which can help bring down the cost.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Book them as early as you can and do it at the station in person. The friendly staff will try to help you find the best deals.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Have a railcard! Whatâ€™s better than getting money off any train ticket you ever buy?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n* Additionally, to save more money whilst travelling, have a sandwich, a drink and a couple of snacks packed from home instead of paying for something overpriced on the way.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWhen you arrive in Edinburgh, you may be tempted to head straight to all the fantastic places there are to visit, but one of the first things I like to do is check out where I am going to be staying. Whether that is to check in, put bags away or just so you can locate it again later at night. One of the cheapest ways to stay overnight is in hostels or pod hotels and there are a couple of these in well situated spots throughout the city. However, there are always the options of an Air-bnb, a regular B&amp;B or a hotel room if youâ€™re savvy at finding the best deals! Iâ€™ve found that with more people to share the costs of the stay, a hostel may be the most affordable option, leaving you with more money to spend elsewhere.

A winding labyrinth of canals, coffee shops, pastel skies and gelato, all poised beneath the tilted head of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. For countless English writers this country has been a birthplace, a home, a resting place and an endless source of literary inspiration. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote a lavish diary during his travels around Italy, which later became the book &lt;em&gt;Italian Journey&lt;/em&gt;. The Romantic poets, Lord Byron, Mary and Percy Shelley and John Keats, were entranced by Italy and they were drawn to it like a magnet. Even James Joyce, who provided the benchmark for modernist literature, couldnâ€™t deny the allure of Trieste, where he lived for ten years.&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAlthough Italy is a literary pilgrimage for authors from across the world, that does not mean the country has not been the mother of its own great writers. I hope to shed a different kind of light on Italy, illuminating the rich history of literature which exists in every popular holiday destination throughout Italy.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dante Alighieri:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBorn in 1265, Dante is the centrepiece of this literary exploration and author of the &lt;em&gt;Divina Commedia&lt;/em&gt; (Divine Comedy). In Florence where he was born, buildings are adorned with plaques quoting the &lt;em&gt;Divina Commedia&lt;/em&gt;, sculptures are dotted around the city and his name is given to many streets, hotels and restaurants. It is impossible not to bump into the ghost of Dante when visiting this beautiful, terracotta-tiled place. Of the many sites to visit, one worth mentioning is the Museo Casa di Dante, Danteâ€™s birthplace and now a museum dedicated to the poet. Another important location for Dante fans is the Chiesa di Santa Margherita, the church where Dante first saw his muse, Beatrice Portinari and likely where he married Gemma Donati (mother of his children). Despite being the oldest church in Florence, the church is still open to visitors. Thirdly, Danteâ€™s rock where the poet allegedly sat writing love poems, is marked by a plaque. If you wish to feel the presence of Dante, or perhaps imagine yourself in his position, then this rock is the spot.&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDespite Dante being the favourite son of Florence today, his relationship with the city in the 13th century was less than harmonious. Due to his political ideologies, Dante was exiled from his birthplace in 1302, and it was only after leaving the city that he composed the &lt;em&gt;Divina Commedia&lt;/em&gt;. After several years of wandering Italy, Dante died of malaria at the age of 56. Regardless of the conditions in which he wrote it, Danteâ€™s poem elevated the status of Italian vernacular, made literature accessible to a wider readership and cemented the destiny of Italian literature; it is because of him that this list of literary landmarks in Italy is possible.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Francesco Petrarca (Petrarch):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOn the website &lt;a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;https://www.discoverarezzo.com/en/location/petrarch-house-museum/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&gt;Discover Arezzo&lt;/a&gt;, the Petrarch House Museum, Arezzo, Tuscany, is described as a building where, â€˜room after room is filled with the air that brought to life the genius of Francesco Petrarcaâ€™. Indeed, this museum is the site of his birth in 1302, and its 14th century rooms are like an enlarged time capsule for visitors today. It is only necessary to wander through the rooms and see the marble statue of Petrarch, to feel as if a connection has been established with the past.&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPetrarch is best known for his poetry, written in a style vastly different to the Mediaeval troubadour poets and Dante; lyrical, elegant, sentimental and often filled with the yearning of an unrequited love. Many of Petrarchâ€™s poems centre around a woman called Laura, (possibly Laura de Noves, who was married) and his poetry speaks of her grace and beauty which he could only ever possess in literature. For many, Petrarch was the beginning of Renaissance Humanism, which focused on a classical revival and what it means to be human, earning his name a place on this list.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Italo Calvino:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI now wish to catapult us forward in time, to October 1923, the moment when Italo Calvino took his first breath. Although he was actually born in Cuba, Calvinoâ€™s parents were both Italian and he returned to Sanremo, Italy two years later; it was here that he spent most of his peaceful childhood prior to World War II.&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHis wartime experiences provided inspiration for Calvino, as much as his relationship with Italy, as embodied in the 1947 novel &lt;em&gt;The Path to the Nest of Spiders&lt;/em&gt; but he later turned to fantasy, allegory and experimentalism. It is these whimsical novels which he is most renowned for. Over his lifetime, Calvino meandered across many Italian cities from Rome to Siena, and the pervasive presence of these locations in his novels is clear. It is almost as if Calvino, bedecked with a high-vis jacket and neon sign, takes his reader on a fictional tour guide of the country.&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIt is difficult to determine a single location where Calvino is most potently remembered. As a man characterised by his wanderings, both real and fictional, his influence is so widespread that it can be felt in a plethora of Italian cities. However, his novelÂ &lt;em&gt;Invisible Cities&lt;/em&gt; described fifty cities which all reveal themselves to be the same one; Venice. Visiting this labyrinth of canals and narrow streets offers a vibrant new way to experience Calvinoâ€™s novel. In addition, visitors may visit the grave of Italo Calvino which is located at the Cemetery of Castiglione Della Pescaia in Grosseto. Here, the end of Calvinoâ€™s journey is marked by a smooth, blank gravestone despite the fact that his words continue to take readers through time and space.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elena Ferrante:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nElena Ferrante is a name that will be familiar to most and beloved by many. Here, I seek to rectify this male-dominated list of Italian writers with a contemporary, female voice. Elena Ferranteâ€™s identity is a mystery, one which has puzzled journalists, fascinated readers and added an intoxicating allure to her books. However, her visceral portrayal of women, Italy and their truths does not require an author; the novels have been wildly successful regardless.&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDespite the â€˜Ferrante feverâ€™, in Italy stories by and about women are often side-lined and dismissed by critics. Ferrante herself said that, â€˜â€œWe women have been pushed to the margins, towards subservience, even when it comes to our literary workâ€ as evidenced by this list of writers, who all have one thing in common; their sex. Now, the â€˜female storyâ€™, told with increasing skill, increasingly widespread and unapologetic, is what must now assume powerâ€ so as not to exclude half of Italyâ€™s population from the telling of its history.&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you were to pin Ferrante to one location, it would have to be Naples where the writer was born and sets her most acclaimed novel &lt;em&gt;My Brilliant Friend.&lt;/em&gt; Being one of the poorest cities in Europe means that Naples doesnâ€™t possess the same grandeur as cities like Florence and Rome. However, Ferrante manages to unveil the beauty and charm that exists even in one of Italyâ€™s more unpolished locations, encapsulated by the unnamed â€˜neighbourhoodâ€™ of her protagonists. Donâ€™t worry, despite the book having an undefined location, there are still plenty of opportunities to visit the filming locations for the HBO film version of &lt;em&gt;My Brilliant Friend&lt;/em&gt;, and garner a sense of the novelâ€™s geographical inspiration. Il Rione is believed by many to be the model for Ferranteâ€™s â€˜neighbourhoodâ€™ and where most of the film is set, whilst other scenes were shot in various locations, such as; Lungomare, Piazza Plebiscito,Â  Galleria Principe and more. Naples, and Il Rione however, remain at the heart of this novel which spans sixty years and shows how a city can transform people as much as people can transform it.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;This tour of Italy and its writers is by no means exhaustive, and there are many more waiting to be discovered down the cobbled alleyways of the past. It can be agreed however that pasta and sunshine are not the only appeal of the country. Italy pulses with creative inspiration, so if you listen closely youâ€™ll hear stories in the clatter of market stalls and poetry carried by the winds high in the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Italy: a literary paradise of sun-bleached houses and coloured roofs.

Donâ€™t worry, despite the book having an undefined location, there are still plenty of opportunities to visit the filming locations for the HBO film version of *My Brilliant Friend*, and garner a sense of the novelâ€™s geographical inspiration. Il Rione is believed by many to be the model for Ferranteâ€™s â€˜neighbourhoodâ€™ and where most of the film is set, whilst other scenes were shot in various locations, such as; Lungomare, Piazza Plebiscito,Â  Galleria Principe and more. Naples, and Il Rione however, remain at the heart of this novel which spans sixty years and shows how a city can transform people as much as people can transform it.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis tour of Italy and its writers is by no means exhaustive, and there are many more waiting to be discovered down the cobbled alleyways of the past. It can be agreed however that pasta and sunshine are not the only appeal of the country. Italy pulses with creative inspiration, so if you listen closely youâ€™ll hear stories in the clatter of market stalls and poetry carried by the winds high in the mountains.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_infoBox\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_thumbnailCredit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Echiner1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_changelog\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_googleAppsUsernameYork\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;kjl534\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_googleAppsUsernameNouse\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;katy.leverett\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_name1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Katy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_name2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Leverett\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_userid\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,148409],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_created\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;2021-10-11T20:28:12.000Z\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_notes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_thumbnail\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;5513\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_changepass\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_deleted\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_suspended\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_facebook\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_twitter\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_instagram\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_linkedin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_snapchat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_bio\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_archive_username\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_archive_email\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articles_featured\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_pronouns\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null]}]}]]\\\\\\\&quot;]}],[0,{\\\\\\\&quot;articles_id\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,150771],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_categories\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;4,322\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_authors\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;148478\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_published\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\&quot;2022-06-15T08:31:23.000Z\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;editions_id\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,938],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_editionPage\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;M20\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_updated\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\&quot;2022-06-15T08:53:27.000Z\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInLists\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInSearch\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInAdmin\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_type\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_slug\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;green-travelling-summer-holidays-without-the-air-miles\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_extraMetadata\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_thumbnail\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;6075\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_lifetimeViews\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,174],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_archiveFallback\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_socialConfig\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;1,1,1,1\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_mediaCharterDone\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_socialExcerpt\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_dropCapital\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_displayImages\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_isThumbnailPortrait\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts\\\\\\\&quot;:[1,\\\\\\\&quot;[[0,{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,813105],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articles_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,150771],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_timestamp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;2022-06-15T08:53:27.000Z\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_userid\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,148409],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_headline\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Green

the summer is often the highlight of the year for most people, there is no doubt that jetting off abroad in large, fuel guzzling, air polluting, jumbo jets is doing the planet no favours with regards to the climate crisis. However, increasing awareness of global warming has inspired new styles of holidays called â€˜eco-breaksâ€™, ranging from cycling tours to rail expeditions. These allow for budding â€˜green travellersâ€™ to enjoy their summer holidays whilst conscientiously reducing their carbon footprint. Even for the frequent flyers among us, who are unable to resist the temptation of catching a flight, airlines are beginning to latch onto the concept of eco-friendly travel and there are now more ways than ever to ensure we are flying in the greenest way possible.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Only a few years ago, taking an eco-break was almost unheard of. But now, due to increased understanding of climate change, being a green traveller is no longer limited to one off gestures; for many it has become a state of mind. However, with growing numbers sacking off the idea of a one off annual holiday and gaining an appetite for the trendier series of several shorter breaks in a year, this has inevitably caused a steep rise in carbon-intensive air travel. This means it has become more vital than ever before that efforts are made to increase sustainability before the climate crisis really does spiral out of control, to a point of no return. Several travel operators such as Feather Down Farms, Forest and TYF have already acknowledged the important role that eco-breaks can play in reducing the impact of climate change, particularly by those who enjoy several holidays a year! These companies offer eco-friendly short-breaks ranging from environ-mentally friendly glamping to sustainable outdoor recreation.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Being a green traveller does not have to involve just holidaying in the UK either. How about taking part in a sustainable cycling holiday? Travel as a foot passenger with your bike on the ferry from Newhaven to Dieppe, France, then cycle the Veloroute du Lin between Pourville sur Mer and Fe-camp. This 50 mile route has become a hotspot for both experienced cyclists and holidaymakers alike. With ferries costing as little as Â£42 per adult, including bike hire, not only is this an ab-solute bargain, but also a prime example of how aeroplanes may be a concept of the past when it comes to travelling abroad.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;If cycling does not take your fancy or isnâ€™t quite the relaxing experience you had in mind, then why not give interrailing a go? There are a multitude of reasons why travelling by train is more preferable than racking up air miles, so this summer take a look at departing from London St Pancras International station instead of London Heathrow airport. Staggering research conducted by Eurostar concluded that a rail journey from London to Paris uses 90 percent less carbon per person than completing the same journey by plane. This significant figure comes as no surprise given that the aviation industry contributes almost 9 percent to global carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Another benefit to travelling by rail is that train stations are often located directly in the town or city centre, meaning that here is no need to waste both money and fuel in commuting to the top tourist attractions, as would often be the case when arriving at an airport due to these rarely being located in a built up area. Walking or cycling from the train station as opposed to getting a bus or taxi from the airport is another simple way of reducing your carbon footprint when travelling. If the environmental benefits of rail travel are not enough to convince you to give it a go, surely the fact that trains offer significantly more leg room and provide the ultimate benefit of having no luggage restrictions is surely enough to persuade you! Not to mention that purchasing rail tickets often gives access to other perks, such as two-for-one tickets to the best museums across Europe, or 25 percent off museums across Italy for ticket holders of any of Italyâ€™s high speed Frecce trains.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;However, it is inevitable that at times, flying will be the only option. Thankfully, being in the golden age of green travel, there are now more ways than ever to ensure that even when catching flights, we can reduce our carbon footprint. Several tour operators, such as British Airways, indicate on their website which flights will be the most eco-friendly, reducing the need of so-called â€˜ghost flightsâ€™, where planes make journeys for very few passengers. Companies such as Booking.com have also provided tools to help tourists select greener accommodation and flights which make choosing lower-carbon travel less of a chore, and far more practical. Whether you are a frequent flyer or a budding explorer, there is no doubt that your summer holiday this year can be spent without racking up environ-mentally damaging air miles.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Whilst going away over the summer is often the highlight of the year for most people, there is no doubt that jetting off abroad in large, fuel guzzling, air polluting, jumbo jets is doing the planet no favours with regards to the climate crisis.

Yet if you look beyond its vibrancy, you will find a difficult, contested history. Throughout the city, it is possible to find testaments of this. From museums and memorials to run down buildings. A few years ago, I was lucky enough to visit Berlin myself and the two sides of the city are striking: on one side, you have the modernity of a fast moving city, and on the other, a haunted past lingering in the crevices of Berlin, an ever-present reminder of the difficulties the city has faced. That being said, here are five different places everyone should visit on any trip to Ber-lin. They are a combination of past and present, as although Berlinâ€™s recent history is difficult, it should not be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reichstag Dome:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe Reichstag is an obvious place to begin on a mainstream tour of Berlin, however, less people know it is possible to enter its famous dome that sits on top of the building. For a small charge, a bit of queuing through security checks, and then a long lift ride up to the dome, once youâ€™re inside, you can walk up to the very top of the dome on a gradually sloping path. It is the perfect moment to take in incredible views of the city: from the top you can see Berlinâ€™s well-known TV tower, the Brandenburg gate and plenty of other landmarks. It is the perfect photo opportunity to remember your trip to Berlin by. I was lucky enough to go into the dome at night: the city was beautifully lit up and it was incredible to see the vibrant nightlife of the city from up high.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Empty Library:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAlso known as the Bibliothek, the Empty Library is a memorial dedicated to the remembrance of the Nazi book burnings which took place in Berlin on 10 May1933 in Bebelplatz. In the book burnings, Nazi students destroyed around 20,000 books written by Liberal, Jewish and Communist authors. The memorial is set in the ground and can be viewed through a square glass panel set in the pavement on the site where the book burnings took place. Beneath the glass panel is a room lined with empty book shelves, enough to house 20,000 books, to represent the books that were destroyed on that day. The memorial is a subtle but moving reminder of the violence Berlin experienced in the 20th century, and is definitely worth visiting to reflect on the cityâ€™s difficult past.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checkpoint Charlie:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOne of the more famous tourist attractions in Berlin, Checkpoint Charlie should definitely be a stop on the tour for anyone interested in the cityâ€™s history. Officially known as Checkpoint C, Checkpoint Charlie was the most well-known crossing point of the Berlin Wall throughout the second half of the twentieth century. Despite the Wall collapsing in 1989, Checkpoint Charlie still stands in the middle of the road that was once one of the only connections between east and west. For anyone wanting to find out more about this part of the cityâ€™s history, nearby is the Checkpoint Charlie Museum, selling a range of merchandise and giving an in-depth history of the Checkpoint and history of the Berlin Wall itself.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rausch Chocolate House:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf you have a sweet tooth, then you absolutely need to visit Rausch Chocolate House, the largest chocolate house in the world. Inside is a beautiful chocolate cafÃ©, serving a range of drinking chocolate, desserts, cupcakes and, of course, chocolates. With beautiful views of the city, the chocolate cafÃ© is the perfect place to relax after a busy morning of sightseeing. Rausch also boasts an incredible chocolate shop: the floor is adorned with incredible chocolate models of iconic Berlin landmarks, like the Brandenburg gate, and sells a fabulous range of chocolate delights. It is all reasonably priced and is perfect for taking back to your accommodation to eat later or as gifts for family to take home.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ampelmann Shops:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOnce youâ€™ve been to all these places, it is likely you will have had to cross the road and seethe iconic Ampelmann illuminate the pedestrian traffic lights. Ampelmann translates literally to â€˜Little traffic light manâ€™. The Berlin Ampelmann wears a little hat and when red, he stands with his arms horizontal, when green, he strikes a walking pose. The image of the Ampelmann has become so associated with Berlin that numerous shops have popped up across the city selling everything from Ampelmann t-shirts and socks to postcards, keyrings and sweets. If you happen to see one when taking in the city, head inside to pick up some brilliant merch to remember your trip to Berlin by.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Berlin has much to explore, whether youâ€™re interested in history, culture or just some good food. These are just five of the many important and incredible sites anyone should visit on a trip to Berlin. If you have the opportunity to go, take it, the city has so much to offer, and a significant but difficult history that should be remembered through visiting.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Berlin â€“ a city known for its cultural diversity and cosmopolitan lifestyle.

It is all reasonably priced and is perfect for taking back to your accommodation to eat later or as gifts for family to take home.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n**The Ampelmann Shops:**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOnce youâ€™ve been to all these places, it is likely you will have had to cross the road and seethe iconic Ampelmann illuminate the pedestrian traffic lights. Ampelmann translates literally to â€˜Little traffic light manâ€™. The Berlin Ampelmann wears a little hat and when red, he stands with his arms horizontal, when green, he strikes a walking pose. The image of the Ampelmann has become so associated with Berlin that numerous shops have popped up across the city selling everything from Ampelmann t-shirts and socks to postcards, keyrings and sweets. If you happen to see one when taking in the city, head inside to pick up some brilliant merch to remember your trip to Berlin by.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBerlin has much to explore, whether youâ€™re interested in history, culture or just some good food. These are just five of the many important and incredible sites anyone should visit on a trip to Berlin. If you have the opportunity to go, take it, the city has so much to offer, and a significant but difficult history that should be remembered through visiting.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_infoBox\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_thumbnailCredit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Katy Leverett\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_changelog\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_googleAppsUsernameYork\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;kjl534\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_googleAppsUsernameNouse\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;katy.leverett\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_name1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Katy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_name2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Leverett\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_userid\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,148409],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_created\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;2021-10-11T20:28:12.000Z\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_notes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_thumbnail\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;5513\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_changepass\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_deleted\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_suspended\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_facebook\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_twitter\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_instagram\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_linkedin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_social_snapchat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_bio\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_archive_username\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_archive_email\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articles_featured\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;users_pronouns\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null]}]}]]\\\\\\\&quot;]}]]\\\&quot;]]\&quot;],[1,\&quot;[[0,\\\&quot;gaming\\\&quot;],[1,\\\&quot;[[0,{\\\\\\\&quot;articles_id\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,150031],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_categories\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;4,2180,3242\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_authors\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;148356\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_published\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\&quot;2021-03-02T16:12:38.000Z\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;editions_id\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,916],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_editionPage\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_updated\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\&quot;2021-03-03T10:46:52.000Z\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInLists\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInSearch\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_showInAdmin\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_type\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_slug\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;the-problem-with-and-the-future-of-microtransactions\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_extraMetadata\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_thumbnail\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;4853\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_lifetimeViews\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,535],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_archiveFallback\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,null],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_socialConfig\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;0,0,0,0\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_mediaCharterDone\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_socialExcerpt\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_dropCapital\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_displayImages\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,true],\\\\\\\&quot;articles_isThumbnailPortrait\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,false],\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts\\\\\\\&quot;:[1,\\\\\\\&quot;[[0,{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,810318],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articles_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,150031],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_timestamp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[3,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;2021-03-03T10:46:53.000Z\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_userid\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,148130],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_headline\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;The future of microtransactions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_excerpt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Adam Frost on the issues with in-game currency what the future looks like for microtransactions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_text\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&lt;p&gt;Whilst paid DLCs were once the number one controversy amongst the gaming community, microtransactions are the current hot topic.

Originally a huge trade show for video games, consoles, accessories and merchandise, it became more like an advertising tool over the years, even opening up in part to the public in 2017. But, as the internet has developed and practices have changed, many questioned the relevance of the event. In 2020, like with so many things, Covid-19 came and killed it.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The idea of holding an event attended by tens of thousands of people in May 2020 was a non-starter, so the event was cancelled. There were some murmurings about an E3 online, however, perhaps not surprisingly with the timescales involved, nothing ever came about. More tellingly however was E3 online for 2021 was being planned.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Details are scarce and rumours abound, but it seems like there was a plan to hold the usual big draw of the main presentations online and have a bunch of other digital events surrounding it. However, right at the start there was talk of big-name developers like Bethesda and EA snubbing the event over the huge price tag for an online-only event and it wasnâ€™t long before the whole thing was cancelled outright.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is that developers have realised they can do it themselves without having to pay six figures or over to the Entertainment Software Association â€“ the people who organise E3. Nintendo stopped doing a press conference as early as 2013, instead of putting together the first â€˜Nintendo Directâ€™ which was a pre-recorded presentation and releasing it during E3. Other developers too had begun to move their presentations out of the actual E3 venue and shifted it to just before the event itself. This shift was perhaps inevitable but Covid-19 sped things up enormously.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the big market players were forced to create their own online presentations, such as PlayStations &lt;em&gt;State of Play&lt;/em&gt; or EAâ€™s EA Play Live and others from Xbox and Ubisoft. Now that theyâ€™ve seen that these can get just as many viewers and are far more flexible for likely a fraction of the cost will they ever really want to go back?&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s not just the AAA developers that are benefitting from this new trend of online showcases. As an indie in the days of E3, the only way to reach such heights was to be shown off in the â€˜PC Gamer Showcaseâ€™ which could only exhibit a handful of games. Now however there are a growing number of indie showcases such as â€˜&lt;em&gt;The Guerrilla Collective&lt;/em&gt;â€™, â€˜&lt;em&gt;The Indie Mix&lt;/em&gt;â€™, â€˜&lt;em&gt;The Escapist Showcase&lt;/em&gt;â€™ and the â€˜&lt;em&gt;Wholesome Direct&lt;/em&gt;â€™.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The banner many of these events fell under last year was â€˜Summer of Gamesâ€™ which promoted events for AAA Devs, Indies and the middle market with things like â€˜The Future Games Showâ€™.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s not just the presentations that made up E3 and itâ€™s not just the presentations that have adapted to our new times. Another big part of the event was the hands-on demos of the games that you got to watch on YouTube as you almost certainly didnâ€™t get to go. Itâ€™s here that Steam has stepped in with its introduction of the â€˜Steam Game Festivalâ€™.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Having run a few times now each of the festivals has offered literally hundreds of limited-time demos to download and play as well as a 24/7 schedule of live streams and developer interviews. The key is that games can only be featured in one festival so youâ€™re sure to find something new every time. With demos often being small and snacky itâ€™s not hard to download a dozen or so and blow through them in a couple of hours seeing what deserves a coveted place on your Wishlist.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;This isnâ€™t perfect of course, with so many demos and the relatively hard-wired Steam interface you often only get to make a snap judgement based on some key art and a title. This means that youâ€™re inevitably going to miss something and browsing can be an arduous affair. Perhaps a more curated zoning system or a way to download a bunch of random demos (with filtering to make sure youâ€™re not going to get something youâ€™re totally disinterested in) would help? Those old demo discs were exciting after all.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;So then, what is the future of the video game trade show? It seems inevitable that the presentations will stay and more demos will be inbound. But could things be even better?&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Devolver Digital is well known for poking fun at the games industry and E3 in particular. Its increasingly wild and disturbing press conferences somehow manage to have a plot stretching over years. In 2020 responding to the cancellation of E3 they released &lt;em&gt;Devolverland Expo&lt;/em&gt;, a free game on Steam that lets you explore the abandoned show floor as it might have been. This features a 3D first-person exhibition where the game booths are far larger and more ostentatious than they ever could be in real life complete with its own secrets and a boss fight.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst an AAA published games conference might be a bit of a pipedream there are those who are working towards making it a reality online. In your year or so of online meetings you may have come across the rather broken â€˜&lt;em&gt;Town Halls&lt;/em&gt;â€™Â  in which you create an avatar and then are able to walk around in a world reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Habbo Hotel&lt;/em&gt; with proximity chat rooms you can dip in and out of.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;A few online events like MAGOnline have been testing the waters using technology to live-stream video screens above virtual booths. NPCs allow anyone to gain information whilst the developers might be engaged in conversations and arcade cabinets allow people to access demos of upcoming games in a mix of downloads and links to Steam. These can be a little janky and of course no real substitute for a live event but it offers some insight into where these kinds of things could go.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;With all of these changes, it seems clear that whilst E3 might be back in 2022, it wonâ€™t be the titan that it once was. There are lots of options and maybe even more exciting future possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;E3 has been king since 1995. Originally a huge trade show for video games, consoles, accessories and merchandise, it became more like an advertising tool over the years, even opening up in part to the public in 2017. But, as the internet has developed and practices have changed, many questioned the relevance of the event. In 2020, like with so many things, Covid-19 came and killed it.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe idea of holding an event attended by tens of thousands of people in May 2020 was a non-starter, so the event was cancelled. There were some murmurings about an E3 online, however, perhaps not surprisingly with the timescales involved, nothing ever came about. More tellingly however was E3 online for 2021 was being planned.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDetails are scarce and rumours abound, but it seems like there was a plan to hold the usual big draw of the main presentations online and have a bunch of other digital events surrounding it. However, right at the start there was talk of big-name developers like Bethesda and EA snubbing the event over the huge price tag for an online-only event and it wasnâ€™t long before the whole thing was cancelled outright.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe problem is that developers have realised they can do it themselves without having to pay six figures or over to the Entertainment Software Association â€“ the people who organise E3. Nintendo stopped doing a press conference as early as 2013, instead of putting together the first â€˜Nintendo Directâ€™ which was a pre-recorded presentation and releasing it during E3. Other developers too had begun to move their presentations out of the actual E3 venue and shifted it to just before the event itself. This shift was perhaps inevitable but Covid-19 sped things up enormously.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIn 2020, the big market players were forced to create their own online presentations, such as PlayStations *State of Play* or EAâ€™s EA Play Live and others from Xbox and Ubisoft. Now that theyâ€™ve seen that these can get just as many viewers and are far more flexible for likely a fraction of the cost will they ever really want to go back?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nItâ€™s not just the AAA developers that are benefitting from this new trend of online showcases. As an indie in the days of E3, the only way to reach such heights was to be shown off in the â€˜PC Gamer Showcaseâ€™ which could only exhibit a handful of games. Now however there are a growing number of indie showcases such as â€˜*The Guerrilla Collective*â€™, â€˜*The Indie Mix*â€™, â€˜*The Escapist Showcase*â€™ and the â€˜*Wholesome Direct*â€™.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe banner many of these events fell under last year was â€˜Summer of Gamesâ€™ which promoted events for AAA Devs, Indies and the middle market with things like â€˜The Future Games Showâ€™.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nItâ€™s not just the presentations that made up E3 and itâ€™s not just the presentations that have adapted to our new times. Another big part of the event was the hands-on demos of the games that you got to watch on YouTube as you almost certainly didnâ€™t get to go. Itâ€™s here that Steam has stepped in with its introduction of the â€˜Steam Game Festivalâ€™.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHaving run a few times now each of the festivals has offered literally hundreds of limited-time demos to download and play as well as a 24/7 schedule of live streams and developer interviews. The key is that games can only be featured in one festival so youâ€™re sure to find something new every time. With demos often being small and snacky itâ€™s not hard to download a dozen or so and blow through them in a couple of hours seeing what deserves a coveted place on your Wishlist.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis isnâ€™t perfect of course, with so many demos and the relatively hard-wired Steam interface you often only get to make a snap judgement based on some key art and a title. This means that youâ€™re inevitably going to miss something and browsing can be an arduous affair. Perhaps a more curated zoning system or a way to download a bunch of random demos (with filtering to make sure youâ€™re not going to get something youâ€™re totally disinterested in) would help? Those old demo discs were exciting after all.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSo then, what is the future of the video game trade show? It seems inevitable that the presentations will stay and more demos will be inbound. But could things be even better?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDevolver Digital is well known for poking fun at the games industry and E3 in particular. Its increasingly wild and disturbing press conferences somehow manage to have a plot stretching over years. In 2020 responding to the cancellation of E3 they released *Devolverland Expo*, a free game on Steam that lets you explore the abandoned show floor as it might have been. This features a 3D first-person exhibition where the game booths are far larger and more ostentatious than they ever could be in real life complete with its own secrets and a boss fight.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWhilst an AAA published games conference might be a bit of a pipedream there are those who are working towards making it a reality online. In your year or so of online meetings you may have come across the rather broken â€˜*Town Halls*â€™Â  in which you create an avatar and then are able to walk around in a world reminiscent of *Habbo Hotel* with proximity chat rooms you can dip in and out of.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nA few online events like MAGOnline have been testing the waters using technology to live-stream video screens above virtual booths.

games\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_text\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;&lt;p&gt;When I consider what gaming means to me, I think about the games I have played over the last 20 years. For me, gaming has helped me keep in touch with friends, laugh, cry, and shout with/at my brothers, and so much more. It has even acted as a gateway into journalism; something I wouldnâ€™t have considered otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Despite my articles on the damaging nature of microtransactions within games, and more recent research about the addictive, as well as rage-inducing nature of gaming, most articles never really give you the full story. Instead, offer solely a myriad of facts with no emotional consideration.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;As of 2020, there were an estimated 2.7 billion people playing video games within their homes. For our parents, this would have been the equivalent of hanging out at the arcade. So, why is gaming so important? Although there are abusive and toxic players online, the majority of players donâ€™t go into lobbies actively trying to ruin somebody elseâ€™s day. In fact, most gamers use multiplayer platforms to stay in touch with friends and family who might live a great distance from them. Therefore, acting as a social platform, gaming â€“ similar to Skype, Facebook or Twitter â€“ keeps us in touch with the people around us.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Then why do single-player games exist? One of the first games I remember playing as a child was &lt;em&gt;Command and Conquer&lt;/em&gt;, not because it had been advertised by some big flashy billboard, but because I had seen my dad playing it. Thereâ€™s always some part of you that thinks whatever your parents are doing must be more fun than what you&#39;re doing, so I gave it a go. This allowed my dad and I to experience games together, which later developed into something we did with my brothers as well. This is similar to how board games would have been a family pastime in decades gone by. Alternatively, I would often find myself playing &lt;em&gt;Pokemon&lt;/em&gt; alone to sit back and relax, as well as exploring &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Fifa&lt;/em&gt;.

For me, gaming has helped me keep in touch with friends, laugh, cry, and shout with/at my brothers, and so much more. It has even acted as a gateway into journalism; something I wouldnâ€™t have considered otherwise.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDespite my articles on the damaging nature of microtransactions within games, and more recent research about the addictive, as well as rage-inducing nature of gaming, most articles never really give you the full story. Instead, offer solely a myriad of facts with no emotional consideration.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAs of 2020, there were an estimated 2.7 billion people playing video games within their homes. For our parents, this would have been the equivalent of hanging out at the arcade. So, why is gaming so important? Although there are abusive and toxic players online, the majority of players donâ€™t go into lobbies actively trying to ruin somebody elseâ€™s day. In fact, most gamers use multiplayer platforms to stay in touch with friends and family who might live a great distance from them. Therefore, acting as a social platform, gaming â€“ similar to Skype, Facebook or Twitter â€“ keeps us in touch with the people around us.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThen why do single-player games exist? One of the first games I remember playing as a child was *Command and Conquer*, not because it had been advertised by some big flashy billboard, but because I had seen my dad playing it. Thereâ€™s always some part of you that thinks whatever your parents are doing must be more fun than what you&#39;re doing, so I gave it a go. This allowed my dad and I to experience games together, which later developed into something we did with my brothers as well. This is similar to how board games would have been a family pastime in decades gone by. Alternatively, I would often find myself playing *Pokemon* alone to sit back and relax, as well as exploring *Skyrim* or *Fifa*. In that sense, single-player games represent the escape from life, similar to how some people sit and read or watch television.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nGaming, although it can carry stigmas such as being anti-social, is a form of entertainment just like any other.

immediatelyÂ recognisable in several video games. ButÂ why is it such a popular setting?&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;We may say itâ€™s because striking down zombies feels less inhumane than doing the same toÂ humans, or because the immersion of exploringÂ a world so unlike our own provides the ultimateÂ form of escapism. However, like famous dystopian novels such asÂ &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; andÂ &lt;em&gt;The Handmaidâ€™s Tale&lt;/em&gt;,Â these narratives may also be conveying their ownÂ insight into humanity.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike novels, video games have interactiveÂ narratives: we are forced to make decisions, watchÂ emotional cutscenes, and embody the protagonistÂ in a way that a novel doesnâ€™t allow us to, even ifÂ written in the first person. These decisions can be used by game developers to offer an insight into humanity.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The dystopian trope in games often forces us to criticiseÂ our society by demonstrating the consequences ofÂ poor decisions and making us play through them,Â while illuminating valuable aspects of the humanÂ condition. The high stakes environment of a zombie apocalypse, for example, can raise questionsÂ about trust and friendship, and a futuristic settingÂ may present the ethical debate surrounding progress with technology. With the dystopian setting,Â developers can break down the walls of our structured society to reach the heart of human nature.Â Can the narratives of video games be as valuable asÂ those of established novels in the literary canon?&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; andÂ &lt;em&gt;Detroit: Become Human&lt;/em&gt; areÂ just two games that share the dystopian genre, butÂ present different settings and problems, and explore a variety of ethical debates. &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;, developed by Naughty Dog, isÂ an award-winning dystopia; its post-apocalypticÂ setting is perfectly suited for its narrative, thatÂ champions the value of human relationships andÂ hope against the merciless and perilous back-ground of an infectious neurological disease thatÂ strips people of their humanity. Joel Miller isÂ initially introduced as a smuggler who survives by any means necessary. He isÂ tasked with â€˜smugglingâ€™ an immune teenage girl â€“ Ellie â€“Â across the country to aÂ group that needs herÂ to develop a vaccine. Of course,Â throughoutÂ their treacherous journey,Â Joel and Ellie developÂ a close relationship,Â where EllieÂ reminds JoelÂ of his lateÂ daughter. HeÂ morphs fromÂ being indifferent about herÂ safety, to saving herÂ life â€“ a decision thatÂ will doom humanityÂ forever.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;We question whether thisÂ decision is justified, but after theÂ emotional narrative that we have experiencedÂ while â€˜beingâ€™ Joel, we are more inclined to agreeÂ with him. This interaction with the narrative isÂ difficult to gain from reading a novel, as it is supported by a genius soundtrack, incredible acting,Â and an engaging script. Therefore, the idea of operating based on fear â€“ of losing your life, or losingÂ someone you love â€“ is added to the concoctionÂ of emotions at play. Crucially, though, this fear isÂ not confined to a dystopia. These fears and emotions are always present in our daily lives,Â and a dystopian setting enablesÂ them to be more prevalent,Â as we evaluate our priorities, and the materialÂ appeal of modernÂ day society ceasesÂ to exist. Even in aÂ post-apocalyptic scenario,Â are humansÂ destined toÂ be in conflictÂ with eachÂ other, ratherÂ than unitedÂ against thatÂ which threatens their existence?&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detroit: Become Human&lt;/em&gt; tellsÂ the story of threeÂ â€˜androidsâ€™ â€“ robotsÂ built exactly identicalÂ to humans, aside from anÂ LED light on their temples. SetÂ in Detroit, 2038, this choice-basedÂ narrative adds an extra dimension to our experience of the game, as every consequence isÂ a result of â€˜ourâ€™ own actions in the lead up to anÂ android revolution, where they protest for equalÂ rights to humans. As more and more androids areÂ becoming sentient and subverting their programming, they develop emotions as complex and undeniably real as a humanâ€™s. This futuristic settingÂ raises questions of human empathy; if we eventually did develop robots on the same level as theseÂ androids, would we support their fight for equalÂ rights? Or would our fear of technology lead us toÂ antagonise and destroy them?&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n&lt;p&gt;The answer to these questions may enable usÂ to learn more about ourselves as individuals, andÂ game developers have been intelligent to provokeÂ their discussion.&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSo then, can a video gameâ€™s portrayal of dystopias have a narrative value, rather than just aÂ â€˜point and shootâ€™ system of catharsis? I argue thatÂ it can, and titles such asÂ &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us, Detroit:Â Be-come Human,Â Bioshock, The Outer Worlds, Cyber-punk 2077, Fallout 4&lt;/em&gt;Â and many more all containÂ valuable messages about the dangers of totalitarianism, dishonesty, and the priceless nature of loveÂ and relationships. These experiences of a dystopian future highlight the best and worst aspects ofÂ humanity, so we can ensure to perpetuate the best,Â and move away from our selfish and complacentÂ tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;],\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;articlesDrafts_markdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:[0,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;From the zombie apocalypse to futuristicÂ Detroit, the dystopian genre is immediatelyÂ recognisable in several video games.
