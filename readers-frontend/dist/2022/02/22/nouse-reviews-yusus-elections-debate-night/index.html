<p><strong>Academic officer</strong></p>
<p><em>Candidates</em>: Matt Best(He/Him) and Deb(He/Him).</p>
<p>The debate between the two potential Academic Officers was very clean, there were no rebuttals and very little engagement with the othersâ€™ policies as each candidate chose to focus on their own rather than that of their competitor. Whilst this did not lead to any viral moments, it did mean that it was easy to compare the two candidates and understand where they were coming from.</p>
<p>Both candidates started by highlighting the need for inclusivity in academic studies, with multiple references to decolonising the curriculum, something which current Academic Officer, Matt Johnstone, later remarked was â€œa long term thing, it will never be over.â€ Matt Best cited his own experience in the Sociology and Criminology departments in doing this, stating that it was necessary to make reading lists more inclusive so that students do not simply receive a list of white authors. In contrast, Deb highlighted the experiences of international students in coming to the University and the practical difficulties which they overcome. He also suggested that new courses could be added to the University curriculum from other universities.</p>
<p>When asked what the University should prioritise, Deb stated â€œEducationâ€ because â€œthis is what we are here for. If you arenâ€™t getting a proper education there is no point in paying such an amount.â€ He was referring to the Â£9250 tuition fees that students pay, and the higher amounts which international students pay for the same course. Matt Best stated that value for money should be prioritised by the University becauseÂ  â€œit is what education is built on.â€ and â€œGetting good value for money means growing as a person.â€ He also highlighted that value for money starts with the small things such as study spaces, stating that if you have a good study space, a student will do better at their course and then have better future prospects.</p>
<p>On the subject of strikes, which is possibly one of the most pressing student issues at the moment, Matt said that â€œIâ€™m sick of it and I know a lot of students are as well.â€ In terms of his support for strikes though, he stated that he saw both sides and if elected to YUSU he will remain aware of the fact that students are very closely split as to whether YUSU should support the strikes.</p>
<p>Deb stated that he would â€œshow [his] solidarity with staff members'' who were striking, alongside recognising that he would â€œconsider the disruption on students at the moment."</p>
<p><strong>Activities Officer</strong></p>
<p><em>Candidates</em>: Rohan Ashar(He/Him) and Joe Radford(Any Pronouns).</p>
<p>To describe the Activities Officer debate as uneventful would be an understatement. Rohan Ashar and Joe Radford were very clear and confident, although it was difficult to unpick the main differences between them. Both candidates tended to start their responses with â€œI agree with that statement.â€</p>
<p>URYâ€™s Beth Hardisty stood out immediately by getting straight to the difficult questions. â€œTo what extent do the University and YUSU support free speech on campus?â€, she asked. Rohan said: â€œThey do support it, but there are certain issues they can be more open and listen to students. Students are the most important and not every decision reflects this.â€ As an example, Rohan referenced the fact that â€œwith regards to the ongoing plans for a new student centre, I donâ€™t think the University has taken much input from YUSU and students.â€ Joe also suggested that the Union wasnâ€™t doing enough to engage with students, as he said that â€œeven though there is encouragement to speak freely, we are not always heard.â€</p>
<p>As a follow up question, Beth then asked the candidates where the line should be drawn in terms of the freedom to speak out. Rohan was clear that when language becomes â€œtoo offensive and discriminatoryâ€ free speech should not be tolerated, while Joe echoed this by saying that â€œwhen people are actively harming other people, the University and YUSU have a responsibility to step in.â€ Rohan suggested that YUSUâ€™s reporting system requires improvement, as he referenced the issues with anonymous memes pages and the difficulty in policing these. Joe highlighted that having served as a student leader for YSTV he has found that more needs to be done in respect to â€œoffering training to student leaders.â€</p>
<p>Both brought up the issue of discriminatory behaviour on nights out and asserted that they would address this issue if elected. Rohanâ€™s main pledge was to improve consultation with students, as he said it was the job of the Activities Officer to â€œenable free speech from students moreâ€ as students are â€œthe most important people at the university.â€ Joe chose to place emphasis on â€œexpanding the reporting systemâ€ and delivering â€œtraining to student leaders.â€</p>
<p>Next up on the agenda was whether the candidates believed that societies were not as inclusive as they should be. Joe immediately established that he agreed with the statement â€œunder the caveat that it is hard when you havenâ€™t received the training.â€ He acknowledged that societies functioned thanks to volunteers giving up their â€œfree timeâ€ and argued that â€œthere needs to be more training coming from YUSU so societies can be more inclusive.â€ Rohan said that the key to improving inclusivity was making societies â€œmore accessibleâ€, as he said that â€œYUSU staff need to have that information and training as well.â€ He added: â€œThere are some very simple things, encouraging student groups to improve accessibility.â€</p>
<p>The position of Activities Officer is perceived by many students as solely taking responsibility for delivering events, such as Freshers week. Beth challenged the candidates by asking them whether there was any truth in this perception. Rohan was quick to assert that events followed supporting students. Rohan said: â€œYUSU have the systems in place for societies to carry out events but the Activities Officer exists in order to provide that support. â€œBoth of us understand what it is likeâ€ Rohan repeated. Joe was keen to reinforce the fact that â€œthere has been confusion over the last few years. There is an event element but first and foremost Rohan and I understand it is more than that.â€</p>
<p>Both candidates expressed their gratitude that they were facing each other in the contest for Activities Officer.</p>
<p>The final question forced both candidates to be less complimentary of each other, as they were asked what they could bring to the role which their competitor couldnâ€™t. Rohan said that his manifesto stood out because everything included in it was â€œrealistic and achievable.â€ He referenced his experience from holding a position in Comedy Society and said that â€œwith some of the stuff on Joeâ€™s manifesto, how practicable is it?â€ â€œIâ€™ve expanded Comedy Society and have the experience of being involved in student life.â€</p>
<p>Next it was Joeâ€™s turn. Firstly, Joe said his â€œexperience as head of YSTVâ€ meant that he had â€œalready worked closely with YUSU on several projects.â€ However, he said that the â€œrole would be in safe hands no matter who was elected.â€ Joe said the candidate elected needs to â€œhit the ground runningâ€ and that his experience with YSTV means that he is best placed to do so.</p>
<p>Both candidates demonstrated that they were well versed in the issues which come with the position, although the debate wasnâ€™t decisive in identifying the main differences between the two. Beth Hardistyâ€™s incisive line of questioning was the highlight of the debate.</p>
<p><strong>York Sport Union President</strong><br />
<em>Candidates:</em> Ashraf Ahmed (He/Him), Kieren Franklin (He/Him) and Francesca Riley (She/Her).</p>
<p>This debate was the only one which featured an existing SABB, and this was evident as both Ashraf Ahmed and Kieren Franklin chose to focus on what they saw as Francesca Rileyâ€™s weaknesses and failures as well as how York Sport Union could be improved. Despite this, Franki clearly detailed what she had achieved in the role so far all while remaining unphased by those questioning her record.</p>
<p>The debate started with candidates being asked about the affordability of sport at York and how finances can be a barrier to student participation. Ashraf highlighted his own use of the activities fund and commented that â€œ[he didnâ€™t} think that is enoughâ€. He recommended that a bursary is introduced for students who are successful at sports, similar to academic bursaries. Franki quickly commented that she has increased the activities fund during her tenure, but that there was more needed to do because of the â€œdifference between a paid member and an active memberâ€ of a club, for example being a paid member because of the activities fund, but unable to access training because of supplementary funds being needed to pay per training session.</p>
<p>She also highlighted the need to fund facilities for sports, a topic which went on to frame the rest of the debate. Finally Kieren chose not to directly criticise the activities fund, but rather focused on improvement of its outreach, he also noted the accessibility of sports for disabled students and international students.</p>
<p>Another topic which featured in the debate was the prioritisation of university and college sport, given that there is often friction between the two. Ashraf and Kieren both highlighted the need to prioritise college sport, citing examples from their own experiences within college sport as to why this is the case. Ashraf said that â€œwe should make it more achievable for peopleâ€ with regards to training times as many are often attending lectures and Kieren commented that current policies were like â€œputting a piece of paper over a water leakâ€ giving the example of the use of the JLD for college football.</p>
<p>Franki, however, highlighted the need to look â€œat the needs of both and making them both work togetherâ€ and that it was â€œdamaging to speak about prioritising one over another.â€ Finally, when asked what their priority was in their manifesto each highlighted very different things. Ashraf said that â€œWelfare is not as widely available as it should beâ€ and that this would be his priority. Franki highlighted her aim to introduce a consultation on integrating gendered sports into non-gendered clubs, stating â€œLets remove the barriers.â€</p>
<p>Finally Kieren focused on inclusivity, specifically with regards to disability and language barriers.</p>
<p><strong>Community and Wellbeing</strong></p>
<p><em>Candidates</em>: Matt Rogan (He/They) and Hannah Nimno (She/Her).</p>
<p>Matt Rogan and Hannah Nimno were evenly matched in this debate. There was little separating the candidates and they both fluently answered the questions.</p>
<p>â€œTo what extent is quality the main issue when it comes to student housing?â€ was the first question presented to both the candidates. Matt said that the heart of the issue was that the houses off campus are â€œcheaper but worse quality.â€ Another issue is â€œthe on campus accommodation is expensive and you are getting less than you would get with an off campus houseâ€ they said. For Matt, the main problem is the difference in housing on Campus West versus Campus East.</p>
<p>Hannah said the issue of affordable housing was a â€œproblem year after year.â€ She added: â€œThere have been a lot of problems with students getting deposits backâ€ and â€œthis academic year weâ€™ve seen quantity issues, with students living in the likes of Hull.â€ For Hannah, â€œthere is an issue of quality and quantity both in equal measure.â€</p>
<p>Both candidates were then challenged as to the major issue with the current housing on offer to students. Hannah was clear that the issue was â€œthe cost of it.â€ She pledged that she would â€œkeep emergency financial supportâ€ in place for students. The University actually providing students with â€œaccommodation optionsâ€ is the major issue Matt argued. Matt added: â€œThe University is almost failing a duty it has of giving students an option of places to live.â€ Matt and Hannah both delivered similar solutions for solving the housing affordability crisis.</p>
<p>The debate then moved on from housing to address how the candidates would ensure that students living on Campus East and outside of campus still felt a sense of community, despite their distance from the hub of university. Matt was quick to heap praise on the current student leaders, as they referenced the â€œfact that we have so many fantastic student leaders and student groups.â€ He highlighted that one of their strengths was their willingness to work with campaigns and movements such as The Last Taboo and The Red Flag campaign. Matt promised to use the position if duly elected to â€œhelp these campaigns where they need it.â€ They encouraged student groups to â€œsay exactly how I can support and help all of these student groups.â€</p>
<p>Highlighting her experience on Constantine Collegeâ€™s committee, Hannah said she had experience of working â€œwith volunteering officers to help bring inclusivity.â€ She gave credit to the work done by PTOs and volunteering officers and promised to work closely with them. One of Hannahâ€™s main pledges was to move â€œour societies and liberation groups to a hybrid as wellâ€, meaning that events can take place in person and online. Hannah said it was important to bring â€œdistanced learners into the community.â€ Matt agreed with Hannahâ€™s pledge to make events more accessible for those not able to attend in person and said that events need to be â€œaccessible both online and on campus.â€</p>
<p>The next question was particularly tricky, as Matt and Hannah were questioned how comfortable they were representing students from different backgrounds and who had different perspectives. Hannah said: â€œI wonâ€™t speak on behalf of a group, without being fully informed about that group.â€ Mattâ€™s response was similar as they said that â€œwhat I want to do is every person I work with, I want to make sure they can use their platform with me to ensure that their issues are accurately addressed.â€</p>
<p>Both candidates have held prior leadership roles, as Hannah spoke about her time serving as chair for The Red Flag campaign, while Matt spoke about his successes while serving as YUSUâ€™s LGBTQ+ Officer for the past two years. Hannahâ€™s strongest performance came when she highlighted the experience she already had under her belt. Hannah said: â€œI have more diversity in the experience I haveâ€ and â€œI have a better understanding of the issues which affect students more generally.â€</p>
<p>Matt was impressive when they spoke about getting to â€œthe root of problems.â€ He said: â€œIntersectionality isnâ€™t just a word, it has so much power.â€ Both candidates agreed that they would not tolerate discrimination in respect to dealing with different perspectives. Matt said they draw the line when â€œit gets to the stage where it is becoming discriminatory, that is where I draw the line.â€</p>
<p>Hannah agreed by asserting â€œI think there is a fine line between an opinion and becoming discriminatory, you have to listen to people and understand that everyone has different opinions.â€ As the debate came to a close, Matt said students should focus on â€œmy successes in the LGBTQ+ officer roleâ€, while Hannah highlighted her valuable experience working as a â€œcampaigns officer for a networkâ€ and her proven track record of â€œconfidently delivering on ideas on behalf of other people.â€</p>
<p>The debate was well contested and students will be left with a difficult choice.</p>
<p><strong>President</strong></p>
<p><em>Candidates</em>: Charlotte Clarke (She/Her), Pierrick Roger (He/Him) and Dylan Kenneth-Laugharne (He/him).</p>
<p>The Presidential debate is the debate which most students look forward to. This year, the candidates are very different in what they are offering, and the debate highlighted this.</p>
<p>The first question was contentious, as they were all asked to give their thoughts on the following statement: â€œI feel represented by YUSU.â€ Pierrick was very clear that he believes â€œstaff get in the way too muchâ€. â€œI donâ€™t feel represented by YUSUâ€ and â€œwe need to fundamentally restructure how representation is done in YUSUâ€ asserted Pierrick.</p>
<p>Dylan chose to adopt a different tone, as he said â€œYUSU do a decent job but it can definitely be better.â€ He suggested that â€œfurther collaboration with the collegesâ€ is needed and argued that what was important was â€œelected representatives taking more control over those who are not elected.â€</p>
<p>Charlotteâ€™s response was also different from the other candidates, as she said â€œI donâ€™t quite feel we are there right now.â€ She pointed to the â€œlack of diversity in YUSUâ€ and the importance in listening to PTOs and liberation officers if elected.</p>
<p>When asked about how they would ensure they were relatable to students, Dylan answered first by saying â€œI am not going to pretend I can always completely understand everyoneâ€™s experiences.â€ However, he added that â€œI can take their experiences on board and move them forward.â€ Pierrick argued that it was necessary to engage in constant dialogue with students to know â€œwhat they want.â€ He pointed to the fact that he was â€œthe only ethnic minority candidateâ€ as important.</p>
<p>Charlotte admitted that she would â€œnot understand every single struggle that every student goes throughâ€ but she said her candidacy was a â€œstep forward for diversity.â€ Charlotte said: â€œstudents have such strong voices here and we really need to enable these voices.â€</p>
<p>The potential presidents were then asked how they would make sure that students feel part of YUSU. Dylanâ€™s answer was distinctive in that he placed emphasis again on involving colleges in the decision-making processes, as he said â€œfurther engagement with colleges and the part time officers involved in the colleges.â€ Pierrick argued that involving PTOs a lot more was critical, as â€œthey are the people who represent their communities.â€ He criticised the fact that currently students cannot give feedback anonymously and said it was important that students had the option to â€œsubmit things anonymously to YUSU.â€</p>
<p>For Charlotte, working with students even before they come to university is what is needed, as she highlighted the â€œmassive issue with student engagement in previous years.â€ One of the most important questions of the debate was asking the candidates what the role of the President was. â€œWork closely with the collegesâ€ and giving students â€œthe right trainingâ€ is vital, insisted Charlotte. Charlotte promised to â€œwork with these smaller voices and help to amplify them.â€</p>
<p>Amplify seemed to be the catchword of the debate, as Pierrick echoed Charlotte by arguing that the â€œrole of the president is to coordinate and amplify.â€ He added that after serving as Environment Officer for YUSU he found that at times it was necessary to â€œGet the right students in the room and say that isnâ€™t okay.â€</p>
<p>Dylan adopted a similar tone to the other candidates by suggesting that the president needed to be willing to â€œfight for the welfare of students.â€ He added: â€œWhen students are going to get screwed over, there needs to be someone in their corner.â€ Dylanâ€™s favourite phrase was pledging to â€œmaximise the wellbeing of students.â€</p>
<p>A unique policy pledge put forward by Pierrick was to deliver Vice-Chancellor Q&amp;As if elected as president.</p>
<p>The candidates were next grilled on how far the job of the president was to ensure that YUSU was transparent to students. Charlotte was quick to assert that â€œtransparency is very important and the running joke in these elections.â€ She provided an example of the current strikes and said it was the role of the president to explain to students why the lecturers were striking.</p>
<p>Pierrick said that â€œtransparency and honesty is synonymous.â€ He called for NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) to be axed and argued that â€œactive policy should be available to everybody on the website.â€</p>
<p>Dylan was complimentary of Pierrick as he said that his manifesto was strong on this and he described transparency as â€œmassively important.â€</p>
<p>The next question was very topical, as the candidates were asked on how YUSU should respond to the strikes and what the presidentâ€™s role was. Dylan admitted that â€œevery strike was differentâ€ but argued that it is â€œthe students who miss out at the end of the day.â€ Pierrick called for greater communication with student unions nationally, while Charlotte spoke about the importance in educating students on why the strikes were happening.</p>
<p>A question which is bound to provoke debate is whether tuition fees should be scrapped. The candidates were very careful and cautious in the way they approached answering this question.</p>
<p>Charlotte said that what was more important was whether students were getting value for their money, while Dylan also said that what was of greater importance is â€œpeople get decent education for their money.â€ Pierrick was clear that â€œtuition fees should be completely scrappedâ€ but highlighted that â€œwe've got a very conservative governmentâ€¦to ask them to scrap that is never going to happen and not a priority for YUSU.â€</p>
<p>The final question of the debate asked candidates what they would do to address sexual violence and assault on campus. Pierrick asserted again that NDAs â€œneed to go awayâ€ and said it was important to â€œwork with the University to fix the basic things, such as security cameras which donâ€™t work on campus.â€</p>
<p>Dylan mentioned that he had already discussed the issue with the Universityâ€™s feminist society and spoke of inviting sexual assault charities to come in and speak to students. Dylan argued that â€œcompulsory consent courses are not enoughâ€, as â€œaccess to security needs to be easier.â€ Charlotte acknowledged that it was a very tricky topic and suggested that she would work with campaigns such as The Last Taboo and The Red Flag campaign.</p>
<p>Pierrick asked the other candidates whether they agreed to making yearly consent training mandatory if elected and they all agreed. Charlotte committed to consent training and Dylan said he had plans to make it â€œmore effective and efficient.â€</p>
<p>The debate was yet again tightly contested and addressed a wide range of issues affecting students.</p>
<p>Voting opened on Monday 21 February and students have until Friday to <a href="https://yusu.org/elections2022/vote">vote.</a></p></div>
