<h3>Results</h3>
Usman Khan was elected President after receiving more votes than rival candidates Jack Ogilvie and Benjaman Fordham.

It has been an absolute pleasure to see Constantine College members, particularly first years, take such a keen interest in elections.

"I hope that their enthusiasm, in achieving the highest electoral participation rate amongst all colleges, continues not only in future elections but as leaders of the College, [the] University and their academic, sporting, entrepreneurial and skilful fields in future. Let's make Constantine College and York produce the leaders and entrepreneurs of tomorrow!"

<h2>Vanbrugh</h2>
<a href="http://www.nouse.co.uk/2014/11/10/college-elections-2014-2/#vanbrugh">Hustings</a>
<h3>Results</h3>
The Vanbrugh Junior Common Room Committee election results were revealed last night in the Vanbrugh JCR before Jazz Night, with the new Chair being revealed in VBar.

The evening was opened by an announcement that 571 students had logged in to the YUSU website to cast their vote, the second largest college voter turnout after Derwent. Rachel Bates, Vanbrugh's returning officer, was thanked for her efforts in coordinating the election administration.

The first results to be announced were the block representatives; Brad Dunkley, the only candidate for Fairfax House Representative, won with 93 votes. Orkney Bankes and Sarah Weinburg were elected as Eric-Milner White Court Representatives after an impressive four rounds of voting. There were also four rounds in the voting for the Le Page representatives, after which Alex Pain emerged as the winning candidate. After two rounds, Rachel Terry and Kajsa Arnlund were elected as Donald Barron/Barbara Scott Court representatives.

The next result was that of Female Sports Representative. Amy Gould, the only candidate, was successfully elected into the position. There were no candidates for Male Sports Representative.

Ananna Zaman and Tom Arnold were elected as Bar and Music Representatives after one round of voting, in which Charles Chester narrowly lost out on being appointed. The highest number of voting rounds was for the four available positions as Events Representatives, but after 6 rounds, Anne-Marie Webb, Carly Miller, Floraidh Tremaine and Simon Irwin were elected from the seven possible candidates.

As the sole candidate for LGBTQ Representative, Sam Fallon secured enough votes to be elected with an impressive 162 votes, giving them the opportunity to carry through their promise on 'increasing visibility' of support for the LGBTQ+ community.
Vanbrugh's new Welfare Representatives were revealed to be the absent Melanie Winyard as Female Representative and Alex Light as Male Representative.

After one round of voting, Julien Wickert was elected Treasurer. In a vote described as "very close", Oliver Binns emerged as the new Vice-Chair For Communications after a year as Webmaster.

Hamish Dudgeon was elected Vice-Chair For Events after receiving 127 votes, setting him far ahead of the other candidates. The runner-up received 76 votes in comparison.

The closest result of the evening was between Amie Nevin and Alex Stephenson, the two candidates for Vice-Chair For Welfare; however, with one vote separating them, Alex Stephenson was elected into the position.

Next year's Chair was revealed in VBar before Jazz Night began; the vote went into five rounds. Millie Beach emerged ahead of the others in the first round, during which Megan Johnston was eliminated. Candidate David Waters was eliminated in the second round, leaving Adam Mitchell-Baker and Millie Beach in the final round. The result was decidedly close, with only two votes between the two. However, with 152 votes once the votes from the first few rounds had been redistributed, Adam Mitchell-Baker lost out to Millie Beech's 154 votes. L.H.
