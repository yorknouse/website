<h3>Hustings</h3>
The Alcuin Junior Common Room Committee hustings took place during the bonus round of Alcuin's weekly pub quiz. There was a noticeable absence of candidates partaking in hustings with the majority of positions being uncontested.

The most contested role was International Students Officer. Hustings began with two speeches from Carla Enrico Foglia and Serafina Basciano. Whilst Foglia's speech centred on her love for people and networking, Basciano claimed she would break down the barriers between different cultures within the University and raise awareness of its diversity.

This was followed by a speech read out on behalf of James Beswick and Joanna Sharpe, the current Sports Representatives, who wish to maintain their positions after their success of seeing Alcuin win sports day last summer and place third in the most recent college tournament. They said they would aim to increase membership if they were to stay on the committee. A second speech read out on behalf of Oliver Angove and Isabel Graham, running for Alcuin's Social Officer positions, saw them claim that their prior experience working with <em>York Vision</em> and Cocktail Society put them in great stead. They also said they wished to raise awareness and turnout of Alcuin's events.

Following the recent resignation of Tasha McNaught, the position of Marketing Officer was filled by Sian Haines, who is running to keep her recently claimed position. Her speech was followed by another uncontested speech from Sophie Jorgensen-Rideout running for LGBTQ Welfare Officer. Stephanie Ellmer and Louise Buckingham, running for RAG Officer, explained their plans to host a spring charity ball.

Further speeches came from Amy May Hulse-Lander, running for Vice-Chair For Business and Communications, who said she aimed to bring in a loyalty card scheme and maintain sponsorship for the College.

Anna Marsh, running for Secretary, proposed dissertation refuges and greater pastoral care in her speech. She also insisted that she would disperse any dictator-like action within the committee and ensure democratic decisions would be made.

'King in the North' Dom Smithies, the current Vice-Chair For Welfare and Support and the only candidate for Chair, promised a college trip abroad and further collaborations with networks and societies to increase the turnout of Alcuin events.

A number of positions had no candidates, including Merchandise Officer and Ethics and Environment Representative. T.P.

<h3>Hustings</h3>
Hustings took place on Tuesday in DBar and began with the role of LGBT officer. Joint candidates Dianne Apen-Sadler and Jennica Allen promised bi-termly meetups, regular feedback to YUSU in response to student comments, and film nights with strong LGBT themes. Henry Winkle said he wanted "more transparency and more democracy" for members of the LGBT community.

The role of Welfare Representative was the most hotly contested position of the night, with eight candidates standing for election. Six of the candidates were running as individuals, with 'Derwent Angels' Jess Geddes and Lucy Wegerif running as a pair. Lizzie Mason, dressed in a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle onesie, promised cookies, a glass of orange juice and a cry after a night out. Maddy Tickell caused a stir in the crowd with the comment "I'm a fresher so I can see things with new eyes".

The main points of discussion for the Events Representative candidates were their plans for Club Ds, with those elected promising bigger and better things for the events this year, with plenty of D-related innuendos added for good measure. When asked about alternative events for non-drinkers and alternative club-nights, trio Freya Kingsley, Lauren Malcharek and Thomas Butler-Roberts brought up the idea of karaoke nights and board game events, whilst joint candidates Alex Urquhart, Matilda Hartley, Edward Highfield and Lewis McDowell suggested a chocolate themed night while simultaneously doing sambuca shots on stage.

The role of Bar Representative was the third most highly contested position. A main point in Ellie Meagher, Georgia Musson, Jonny Long and Max Palfreman's policies include the installation of cashback at D-Bar, a theme that then became the focus for many more questions across the remainder of the night. Another group made up of Issy Roberts, Jess Bromovsky, Bertie Wnek and Callum McCulloch suggested the implementation of a beer-pong tournament and speed dating night as "finding love is the most important thing".

Throughout the night, candidates had to undertake challenges after their speeches. The students running for Bar Representative were asked the capital of Australia, which Bertie Wnek immediately answered, forcing the remaining candidates to eat a raw onion. Other challenges included wheelbarrow races around DBar, numerous dance offs and a condom blowing competition.

Sarah Lock and Alice Beattie, who ran as a pair, were uncontested for the role of Volunteering Representative. They talked about their experiences of volunteering in the past, and their plans to hold a termly volunteering fair in the College to give students more access to volunteering opportunities.

The two candidates running for Chair, the position that finished off the night's proceedings, were Peter Bunce and Rosalie Dowding. Dowding's main points included a bigger use of the Junior Common Room, such as introducing free coffee mornings and papers on a Sunday to push inter-block interaction, and putting laptop and phone chargers at the porters for students who have forgotten to bring theirs to campus. Bunce's campaign focused on reinvesting in the College, keeping finances afloat, and increasing participation in college sport to make it more inclusive for all Derwent students, particularly LGBTQ and international students. Bunce's idea of creating a Derwent motto was met with cheers from the crowd. G.M.

<h2>Goodricke</h2>

<a href="https://www.nouse.co.uk/2014/11/18/college-elections-2014/#goodricke">Results</a>

<h3>Hustings</h3>
The evening kicked off with speeches from the Entertainment Officer candidates. Sarah Fender and Olivia Wilkinson stressed the need for more events whilst Helena Bland wanted more bar crawls as well as events for those who do not drink. 

Kelly Allwood and Abbie Greenwood were keen to stress the need for more 'alternative' events throughout the year, whilst Kayleigh Ann Motan said she wanted to organise more small sided sports tournaments as well as day trips into York.

Robert Jackson, running uncontested for Environment and Ethics Officer, promised to work closely with residents and establish sustainable recycling schemes. Creative Media Officer candidate Ayshe Zaifoglu did not prepare a speech with the intent of showing off her own spontaneous creativity, whilst both Amy Ward and Sarah Barrass stressed their experience in creative arts.

The two candidates for International Officer, Angel Wu and Lidingrong Huang, both said they recognised the difficulties of being an international student and pledged to help out. Female Welfare Officer was contested by two candidates with Shannon Webb wanting to introduce a new blog and more debates whilst Gaby Kendrick wanted to give students whatever they needed, whether that be free food or free condoms.

The position of Male Welfare Officer was also contested with Connor Goodwin promising to improve accessibility and revitalise the drop-in scheme. Peter Redshaw made his voice heard by performing a welfare-themed poem, which was met with cheers from the crowd.

Chloe Carbis and Eloise Orrey, running for Merchandise Officer, promised to make merchandise more appealing and accessible as well as suggesting new Goodricke-themed products, such as laundry bags. 

The most contested position of the elections, RAG and Volunteering Officer, saw only three sets of candidates attend hustings. Jasmin Hayward and Isobel Fisher stressed their experience in volunteering, whilst Emily Marsden said she wanted to increase awareness of what RAG. Katie Fozzard and Bronwyn Wheeler sang a RAG-themed song to the tune of Jessie J's 'Price Tag'.

Incumbent Ben Ezard stressed his experience as the current Technical Officer whilst Jonathan Brown, running for Social Officer, promised "legendary socials" and said he wanted to take Goodricke both up and down the country. 

David Aiken and Adam Tilley, running for Sponsorship Officer, said they wanted each Goodricke event to have its own form of sponsorship whilst Rebecca Saw said she wanted lots of small businesses to sponsor the College. Sports Officer Peter Fisher stressed his love of sports and experience as a personal trainer whilst Zoe Woodgate wanted to make college sport more prominent.

Polly Hanford, the only candidate for Secretary, pledged to be both helpful and organised, whilst the position of Treasurer was hotly contested. All three candidates stressed their experience with numbers, with Sean Humphrey claiming to fight to get as much money as possible, Laura Cook claiming that she would listen to any suggestions and Mage Liu saying she would enjoy the boring day-to-day jobs that came with the role. 

Lauren Clarke and Hannah Davies contested the position of Vice-Chair for Services. Davies pledged to make GoodFest a two day festival whilst Clarke believed that a two day format would not work, instead stressing the need for more alternative events. 

There were two candidates for Vice-Chair for Welfare. Dominic Arnold wanted professional input in Goodricke's welfare system as well as for the whole welfare team to have first aid training. Clare Trevanna wanted to improve drop-in sessions and establish specific support sessions for finding houses and escaping exam stress.

The last position of the night, Chair, was contested for by three candidates, Jack Sampson, Megan Darrell and Richard Payne. Both Sampson and Darrell wanted to improve the transparency of the JCRC whilst a speech was read on Payne's behalf outlining his plans to give Goodricke some very special moments in the forthcoming year.

<h3>Hustings</h3>
The Halifax College Student Association Hustings took place in JJ's on Monday night. The event was well attended and all the candidates were thoroughly questioned by current HCSA.

The proceedings kicked off with the Executive Committee positions, most of which were contested. Three candidates nominated themselves for the position of President. In their speeches, they all emphasised their vision to improve Halifax's image within the University. The College's theme of active living was a main focus for the nominees with a heavy emphasis on plans to increase sport participation and make use of the nearby 22 Acres. The recurring issue of Halifax lacking a bar was questioned to which Christine Saunders explained that limited footfall during the day was the main reason.

The role of Vice-President for Events and Services saw two candidates compete. Creating big events that would attract a campus wide audience was a popular plan alongside running more family friendly events.

Ryan Westall and Josh Salisbury were the only candidates for the positions of Vice-President for Activities and Sport and Vice-President for Well-Being respectively. Salisbury said that he would like to leave office and be able to say that Halifax is the "safest college" by offering first aid training courses.

Three candidates put themselves forward for the position of Secretary. Incumbent Jake Strong emphasised his experience, saying he would be well placed to get the new committee off the ground and running, whilst Hannah Dabin and William Thomas-Sam showed their desire to do more for their college. The final executive position to be contested was that of Treasurer which saw three of the four nominees speak.

The rest of the evening comprised of speeches for the other contested positions. These included RAG Officer, with candidates being questioned on how to get more people involved in college volunteering.

Caitlin Sherrard, running for one of the two Well-Being Officer positions, spoke of her desire to "remove the stigma of mental health" by challenging people's ignorance on the issue and showing solidarity with those suffering from mental health issues. This coincides with York Mind as one of the College's potential charities.

The main points of discussion during the speeches and questions for LGBTQ Officer were creating inclusive LGBTQ events in JJ's which would be casual and non-alcoholic and increasing awareness of and preventing transgender bullying.

One of the most heavily questioned candidates was Anoosh Djavaheri, running for Merchandise Officer. When asked about clearing the large stock of merchandise, he suggested having a sale with the eventual aim of creating more appealing college merchandise. A.H.

<h3>Hustings</h3>
Hustings began with speeches from the candidates for Sponsorship Officer. Barney Gibb said he wanted to "keep up the good work" of the current Sponsorship Officer by improving relationships with businesses to raise more money for college events. Dyaus Gohil-Patel and Cole Tennant-Fry made similar points about strengthening existing links and surprised the audience with a short poem.

Jonathan Rukundo and Ryan David Wilson, joint candidates for Merchandise Officer, promised a wider range of merchandise in their spoken-word-style speech, whilst Bea Watts and Polly Hanson, running together for Press and Publicity Officer, said they wanted to produce a student-run magazine.

A speech was read out on behalf of Emilie Braathen, the only candidate for International Officer (Welfare), outlining her aims to build a stronger cultural community. Sophie Verdu, the only candidate for International Officer (Events) shared her own experiences of coming to York as an international student and said she would hold more socials at the beginning of the year.

Becca Waugh and Caitlin Quinlan, joint candidates for Volunteering Officer, said they wanted to make it easier for students to get involved with volunteering and dismantle the "student stereotype" by building links with the local community. Penny Lawn and Becky Henerty, running for RAG Officer, also talked about increasing student involvement and proposed raising money through interblock challenges.

The candidates for Sports Officer all pointed out their involvement with university and college sport, with increasing participation being a common theme in their speeches. Both Peer Support Officer roles (male and female) were uncontested.

Increasing the number of trees on campus was a popular policy shared by the candidates for Environment and Ethics Officer, whilst the two sets of joint candidates for Communications Officer both spoke about holding drop in sessions and using online polls.

William Wright and Tom Walker, running separately for LGBTQ Officer, both mentioned the need for providing freshers with more information, whilst Ashley Reed suggesting holding more events on Heslington East in partnership with LGBTQ Social.

The improvement of college bar crawls was a common aim of the Bar Officer candidates, with Tyler Hilborne and Connor Williamson saying they wanted to run a 'Hes East vs. Hes West' event. Ellie Stones and Grace Wren stressed they wanted to "provide something for everyone". Hira Bashir and Ben Jancso, running for Ents Officer, highlighted their involvement with the summer and winter ball preparations, whilst Rachel Lockwood and Grace Flaherty proposed a 'booze cruise on the Ouse' event alongside more daytime activities.

Bradley Chalker, running for Secretary, said he wanted to make communication more efficient, whilst Francesca Sterlini said she would bring a more personal feel to the role. Ben Hudson said he would bring more revenue into Langwith as Treasurer. His rival Tariq Perera said he wanted to make tickets to college events less expensive.

Alex Glynne-Percy, the only candidate for Vice-President For Activities, proposed a partnership between sport and RAG. Both candidates for Deputy President For Welfare talked about improving the STYC system, including introducing more alternative and 'reserve' STYCs. Vice President For Ents candidates Kailie Cutler and Oliver Henn were quick to highlight their experience as Events Co-ordinators during the past year, whilst rival Andrea Baiocchi said events should be cheaper.

President candidate Min Yung Chow did not attend hustings, but rival candidates Alex Byron, Harry Illingworth, Ruth Maku and Gregory Waddell all talked about continuing the College's campaign for a common room. Byron also proposed making college sport free for a term whilst Illingworth talked about increasing communication between colleges. A.W.

<h2>Vanbrugh</h2>

<a href="https://www.nouse.co.uk/2014/11/18/college-elections-2014/#vanbrugh">Results</a>

<h3>Hustings</h3>
Hustings took place on Tuesday in Vanbrugh Dining Hall and began with speeches from the candidates for non-executive positions.
 
Amy Gould, the sole Sports Representative candidate, stressed her commitment to maintaining Vanbrugh's free sport. The next set of candidates to speak were those competing for block representative positions. There were four nominees for the role of Le Page Court Representative. Their dominant policy was that of improving the quality of accommodation by providing more facilities. 

The candidates for Donald Barron/Barbara Scott Representative all showed the desire to improve interaction between the isolated accommodation and their college, whilst the nominees for Eric Milner-White Court Representative agreed that communication between Blocks A and B is a priority. The candidate for Fairfax House Representative was not present. 

Following a break, the heavily contested positions of Events Representatives drew huge attention. There was a heavy focus upon making events cheaper and holding more of them. Simon Irwin and Taraka Rhodes, running jointly, said that they wanted big events to take place throughout the year, whilst candidate Carly Miller summed up her manifesto in an amusing poem. 

This was followed by speeches from the the sole nominees for LGBTQ Welfare Representative and Disabilities and Access Welfare Representative, who received no questions from the audience. Sam Fallon, running for LGBTQ Welfare Representative, said he wanted to increase the visibility of support for LGBTQ students.

After short speeches by the three prospective candidates for the Welfare Representative positions that were present, the speeches for the executive positions began. The candidates for Treasurer were heavily questioned, with a popular topic being the issue of how to keep Vanbrugh moving away from debt. Julian Wickert, running for Treasurer, said he wanted to increase transparency so that more students are aware of the JCRC's monetary situation. 

Vice-Chair for Communications candidate Toby Churchley's policies included implementing bi-weekly block runs. Oliver Binns, the current Webmaster, emphasised his experience and his improvement of the Vanbrugh website, whilst Jack Elliot said he wanted greater pre-warning of events and more information on the website. 

Only three of the four candidates for Vice-Chair for Events were represented, with increasing the diversity of events being a popular policy. All of the candidates talked about their previous experience of organising events. Alex Stevenson was the only one of the two nominees for Vice Chair for Welfare to be present at hustings. 

The event was concluded with speeches by the four candidates for Chair. Megan Johnston expressed her wish to have a college trip abroad at the end of the year and to see renovations to the Junior Common Room. David Waters showed his enthusiasm for the College and pointed out his relevant experience as a STYC and Fairfax House Representative. Millie Beach spoke about potential welfare improvements, introducing 24 hour porters and weekly drop-ins with the Chair. The final candidate to give his speech was Adam Mitchell-Baker who said that his position as Chair would mean being a "representative of the students" and therefore a voice for their concerns. 

Thomas Ron, Disabled Students' Officer, queried how the candidates would ensure that disabilities are taken into consideration in the new buildings which are being constructed. The responsive was unanimously to ensure there is collaboration with YUSU and be involved in every stage of the planning process. 

To round off the evening, Michael Duncan, the current Chair, asked the candidates what they would have done differently to him. Beach's response was greater "pushing of block reps" to ensure that they were more involved. Johnston suggested "more visibility" to show the Vanbrugh JCRC as a representative body, whilst Waters understood there to be a preoccupation with debt last year which should change this year. The last candidate to speak was Mitchell-Baker, who said he wanted to "make everyone feel appreciated". A.H.

<h2>Constantine</h2>

<a href="https://www.nouse.co.uk/2014/11/18/college-elections-2014/#constantine">Results</a>

<h3>Hustings</h3>
The first ever Constantine Student Association election hustings were held in The Forum on Monday night and drew a noticeably large audience of around 70 students. Despite the College's short history, there are approxiamtely 40 candidates standing for committee positions. The main theme of the evening which appeared in many speeches was the founding spirit of the College, and the need to "put Constantine on the map".

The evening was kicked off by returning CSA members Jacob Turner and Cat Santini, who have volunteered to stay on in order to organise the elections which are a landmark event in the brand new college's history. The majority of the positions were contested, with up to four candidates for several positions which sparked several debates amongst the nominees, especially for the role of President. However, the role of Vice-President was uncontested, as were the positions of Chair of Activities, Chair of Campaigns and Marketing, Male Student Well-Bring Officer, International Officer and LGBTQ Officer.

There were absences for several positions, including candidates for Disability and Access Officer, Business and Enterprise Officer, Chair of Events and the role of Treasurer.

Beth Francis, the candidate for Disability and Access Officer who attended hustings, began the evening with a speech concerning educating people about disabilities through stories and campaigns. She also proposed holding informal coffee sessions to help students with learning disabilities with practical tasks such as filling in application forms.

A number of first-year students are running in the elections, including Mobayo Oguntunde, an Event Officer candidate who proposed to abolish the "reputation of Hes East as an anti-social" place through "event experimentation". Further speeches came from Anton Kozak, who focused on student feedback based events, and first-year Robin Plaice who proposed a board of student ideas for The Forum. In contrast, Faye Austin's speech focused on a "more diverse range of club nights".

Amongst the most popular ideas of the night was creating a closer student community amongst colleges on Heslington East campus. This issue was raised by several candidates, including non-contested LGBTQ Officer candidate and current college mentor Kit Gow, who proposed to found a 'Hes East network' in order to educate students about LGBTQA matters. They also stated that an LGBTQA network in Heslington East would help build a "strong community in order to build student confidence". Sebastien Waters, running for RAG Officer, was equally enthused about the possibility of cross-campus connections on Heslington East, proposing an on-campus swap shop.

One of the most contested positions was Chair of Student Well-Being, with all four candidates focusing on student happiness within Constantine College. James McLean stressed that the CSA Well-Being should not appear as a "list of hierarchical names" but rather as "equals, known amongst the College".

Although all the candidates for Chair of Well-Being said they thought the current training was sufficient, Meredith Lambert, running for Chair of Events, thought that more confidence in STYCs was needed in order to cater for "shy people". Those running Well-Being Officer focused upon the issue of mental health and "quick access to friendly advice".

The night was closed by the speeches from the candidates for President, Benjamin Fordham, Usman Khan and Jack Ogilvie. Khan focused on opportunities for students to study in Constantine, suggesting bookable study rooms in The Forum. Fordham proposed that there should be a bar in The Forum, as well as the opportunity to smoke on the balcony. Speeches were closed by Jack Ogilvie, current Vice-Chair for Community, who stressed the need for "realistic" expectations. He focused on the need for faster maintenance responses, as well as better sports facilities within Constantine. L.H.
