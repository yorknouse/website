      <p class="text-xl sm:text-2xl">Cookie Policy</p>
      <p class="text-xs xl:text-sm 2xl:text-base">
        We use cookies and similar tools on our website, to enhance your user
        experience and help us improve our website. This policy explains how we
        do that.
      </p>
      <div class="my-2">
        <h4 class="text-lg sm:text-xl">What are cookies?</h4>
        <div class="text-xs xl:text-sm 2xl:text-base">
          <p>
            Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your
            computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page. The
            cookie will help the website, or another website, to recognise your
            device the next time you visit. Web beacons or other similar files
            can also do the same thing. We use the term “cookies” in this policy
            to refer to all files that collect information in this way.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many functions cookies serve. For example, they can help
            us to remember your username and preferences, analyse how well our
            website is performing, or even allow us to recommend content we
            believe will be most relevant to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certain cookies contain personal information - for example, if you
            click to “remember me” when logging in, a cookie will store your
            username. Most cookies won't collect information that identifies
            you, and will instead collect more general information such as how
            users arrive at and use our websites, or a user's general location.

        <h4 class="text-lg sm:text-xl">What sort of cookies does Nouse use?</h4>
        <p class="text-xs xl:text-sm 2xl:text-base">
          Generally, our cookies perform up to three different functions, in
          descending order of importance:
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold">Essential cookies</p>
        <p>
          Some cookies are essential for the operation of our website. For
          example, some cookies allow us to identify registered users and allow
          them to access the "back-end" sections of the website.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold">Performance Cookies</p>
        <p>
          We use other cookies to analyse how our visitors use our websites and
          to monitor website performance. This allows us to provide a high
          quality experience by customising our offering and quickly identifying
          and fixing any issues that arise. For example, we might use
          performance cookies to keep track of which pages are most popular,
          which method of linking between pages is most effective, and to
          determine why some pages are receiving error messages.

        <div class="text-xs xl:text-sm 2xl:text-base">
          <p>
            Advertisers sometimes use their own cookies to provide you with
            targeted advertising. For example, advertisers may use a profile
            they have built on sites that you have previously visited to present
            you with more relevant advertisements during your visit to
            nouse.co.uk. We believe that it is useful to our users to see
            advertisements that are more relevant to their interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also use or allow third parties to serve cookies that fall into
            the categories above. For example, like many websites, we use Google
            Analytics to help us monitor our website traffic. When you share an
            article on Facebook or Twitter using the buttons provided,
            third-party cookies may again be used.
