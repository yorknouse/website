# Set up a local development enviroment 


New docs for the 2025/26 rewrite.

## Edit backend

This is a replacement for the old php site written using Next.js.

It connects to the database, provides an article management user interface for the committee and serves api endpoints to the frontend website.

To get up and running for local development you'll need to set a few things up first.

Todo: finish writing set up docs!
